"Post: How to avoid a relapse? I've been having a particularly rough year; I attempted suicide, the love of my life left me, I failed my year at university, I've been physically assaulted, I've been sexually assaulted and today my grandfather died. I feel like I'm running on empty and doing the bare minimum to survive for myself while trying to be a rock to others. My emotional resilience has been wiped out. I feel ""okay"" but I've felt like this in the past and it has turned out that I've just been lying to myself and making things worse. Any advice on how to manage/process my emotions? Or just how to better understand myself?",reddit_train.csv
"Post: This is how I feel and I have a slight sense I am the only one to think think this way. I am depressed? Help wanted I yearn for the days I was in high school. I felt as if I was always happy and never worried about anything. I am 22, just having graduated from University. It seems each day I am becoming a person who does not want to have a relationship with anyone other then my family. I want to be alone. Happiness to me is being sheltered by reality--alone with my thoughts. I deleted every single bit of social media I had about a year ago (SC, FB, Insta, Twitter, etc) in an attempt to become as alone as possible. I truly deep down wish I was never born, but I would never ever commit suicide. I wish more then anything else that I can just disappear and leave this world. I am studying for the MCAT currently. I don't have any problem doing so because of my extremely addictive personality, but I find that I enjoy things that take my mind off of reality. Studying, reading, listening to music or going for a drives are my favorite ways to achieve this. But the reality I see is that this world is shit. I believe that as a whole, humans are riddled with greed and selfishness that are the motivations behind MOST of everything in this world. And by humans, that obviously includes myself and I hate myself down to the core for the selfish things I have done. Maybe I am too cynical or something. But this bad world syndrome fucks my brain and idk. I REEEEALLLLY question every aspect of life and I can't help it. Each time I am left with questions that completely make me hate the way this world is. I guess I can give one example. The most recent self-philosophical argument I had is the idea of wars, with murdering others specifically. We praise those who fight for our country, yet at the same time a great deal of these same people are super religious. Do people not evaluate the reality they are in? Do they not question why they believe the things they do? Am I the only one? Does someone's act of ending another life provide justification for doing the same? Who is to even say so? If they would kill all of us if we did not kill them, then what makes our lives worth more? That's just one example, but then I look at areas like American healthcare or the fact my family and others are wealthy while there are people fucking dying because they cannot get water or food. Even the American political system with the deep state and shit. Why are we even on this damn earth? Seriously, what is the point of everything in life? I simply don't view the joys of life being worth living for. I just don't understand. This whole text here is just me rambling my thoughts in hopes that someone somewhere reading this could maybe help me.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Advice for getting back in touch with everyday life? I think the hardest thing for me, and the largest factor I need to address to try and feel healthy again, is simply trying to feel engaged in and enjoying the present. Right now, days have little to no meaning at all, and I am only really able to think of my life in terms of weeks, months, and years. As a result of that, I feel nothing from the hobbies or moments that would before provide me feelings of joy, satisfaction or just generally fulfilling myself. The only activities I really ""enjoy"" anymore is anything that provides me with a complete escape from reality, however these activities are not exactly one belonging to a healthy lifestyle. I just want to enjoy the things that I used to enjoy, but whenever I try I feel like I am wasting my time, are not doing them well enough. Has anybody gone through something similar, and has advice for how they managed to get through it? Thanks for reading.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Having a really bad stretch of days.. Hi all, I know this sub moves kinda fast but I just wanted to vent, hopefully some of you read this.. So my story is that I've had depression and social anxiety for about 15 years or so (at least that's when I recall starting to feel ""off"".. I'm 29 now).. Because of my poor decision to bottle things up and accept that I'm unhappy I put off seeking help until about a month or two ago in which I started going to therapy. It had taken a rather bad mental fallout that occurred in early December for me to finally reach out for help. In my sessions we've been working on techniques to combat both my SA and depression, these include going to places alone such as coffee shops, yoga classes, shopping malls, etc. (Keep in mind I have ""functioning"" social anxiety where I can physically be around people but I'm extremely uncomfortable the entire time and have a very difficult time interacting with people).. The thought process being that my depression stems from loneliness and my SA contributes to that.. It's been a big step for me to try and go out on my own, but I've been doing it almost every day even though it doesn't seem to be creating any improvement. Unfortunately the last few days have been incredibly difficult, I'm getting a very sick feeling of hopelessness and worry that my life is now just constantly shuffling around desperately trying to find something in the world that will ""fix"" me. I tried to sit at home last night to give myself a break and I couldn't even do that, I started becoming consumed by those bad thoughts and began having a panic attack.. So I decided to just go drive aimlessly even though we were in the middle of a snow storm.. I feel miserable again today and I'm just running out of steam to keep going, I really don't know what to do anymore.. I'm exhausted from constantly forcing myself into uncomfortable public situations but at the same time my home feels like a prison.. I have nobody to talk to or gain support from anymore, the couple of friends that I have all have their own lives with wives and kids and my family has been out of my life for 10 years and for good reason.. I know nobody has answers as to what I should do but I just needed to rant",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I just took a shower for the first time in 2 weeks, and I just washed my hair for the first time in months. I know that's absolutely disgusting, but Depression has made me lose all will to do anything, and that includes hygiene.

Post: I am tired of spending every weekend crying. It didn't used to be this bad. I was fine being alone and forgotten. I don't know what changed though. I guess it all just caught up to me. I have felt depressed for as long as I can remember but I was always able to handle it. I am really losing it lately though. Last year was bad. This year is already worse. I am too much of a quitter to make things better. I don't even know why I am posting this. I guess I just want someone to know I was hear.,reddit_train.csv
"Post: Anxiety and Depression make you contradict and lose yourself I've had enough. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for months and the whole situation is fucking my mind up. I know I should face my problems but I don't want to and that amplifies my anxiety. I just wish people ignored me and yet I feel lonely. I don't want to be hurt and yet I am the one hurting myself. There is so many things I'd like to do but in the end I end up wasting time on the bed. There is many things I want and yet I can't bring myself to work and get them. If I oversleep I feel like shit, If I sleep too little I feel like shit. I've talked about my situation with my family and they are trying to support me (I'll start therapy in September) but I can't help feeling like a burden... My motto has always been ""The truth is in the middle"" but I've completely lost any direction and orientation. I've been costantly questioning myself and I don't even know what I want nor who I am anymore. I apoligize if this doesn't make sense but I just needed to let it out a bit.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: How much longer can I fake it? I'm 33, had a full-time job for several years and have a young son. I took a leave from work in 2014 for mental illness, at which point I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, prescribed Zoloft and was back at work when my short term disability ran out. This was the first time I'd been on anti-depressants. I felt tired all the time, had no sex drive, and started gaining weight, but at least I was functional. Over the next year, I received a few verbal warnings and 1 written warning at work about my poor performance. Eventually, the mask broke and I was on leave again in 2015. This time I was away for much longer, was diagnosed w/ dysthymia, tried several different medications, found out that just about every SSRI gave me horrible side effects (sweating, nausea, insomnia, no sex drive, I'm actually thinking now that maybe they caused serotonin syndrome) and eventually landed on Remeron and Wellbutrin. This combo actually started to work, without any side effects (except for weight gain, which I've been managing with a diet now). This time, I returned to work because I received notice in the mail that my employment was going to be terminated because it was coming up on 2 years without being at work. I figured if I was going to be fired for not returning, I may as well return, make some money and worst thing that happens is I get fired anyways. I was not better when I returned to work, I was functional, I was able to smile, but the low mood persisted in a big way. And so here I am, still working, trying to fake it everyday, feeling like a house of cards thats ready to topple. I'm afraid because if I go off work again that will have been 3 leaves of absence, and I really don't think I could show my face around here anymore after that. I remember how horrible my life felt when I was on medical leave. I remember falling behind on child support, having to borrow money from my parents. I remember trying to convince my girlfriend that my low sex drive was because of meds and not because of her. I remember trying to convince an insurance company that I'm sick, while simultaneously trying to convince myself that I can get better. I remember feeling like a useless waste of skin that drained on the resources of everyone that dared to care about me. I guess what I'm saying is I know, right now, I'm suffering from depression, and I'm afraid of what might happen if I admit that again.",reddit_train.csv
Post: Does anyone else's depression causes them to constantly daydream or imagine their lives are a documentary? I daydream a lot about people I know in real life or situations I wish would happen. It's alternate reality I go to escape my loneliness. I sometimes daydream about being in a hotel in some tropical paradise or being in a very romantic date or just that I'm in some kind of reality TV show/documentary where I'm the star and the narrator at the same time and everyone admires me. My mental state worsens once the daydreaming is over and I realize it's just fantasy. :/,reddit_train.csv

"Post: exhausted this is my first time posting on this subreddit but I need something to regurgitate everything that I’m feeling as it may be the only thing that stops me from trying to hurt myself. I’ve only slept for about 2 hours and I have to be up for work in 30 minutes which is making me feel worse. As my depression has gotten worse, I find myself sinking further into a place where I have no desire to help or look after myself. I still live at home with my parents and since my mom is aware of my attempts to hurt myself, she has taken on a lot of the responsibilities that I once had for myself. Like cooking for me, cleaning for me, taking me to work sometimes, sleeping in my bed with me. I feel so fucking bad about that, I feel bad for her and I feel bad that she’s really the only person. I have my boyfriend who has been as supportive as he can be, especially because he’s dealing with his own obstacles and I feel like I’m incapable of being there for him. I keep having thoughts of breaking up with him and becoming so sensitive towards everything he says and it makes me beyond words angry at myself that I have failed him and our relationship. I can’t make me happy, I can’t make him happy and I won’t make anyone happy ever. I am attention and reassurance seeking, I get so angry at the successes of others because I’m not good enough. My identity is shattered and especially because now all I can think about is how sad I am. If I’m on this downward spiral now, will I ever get out of it?? If I have to live with this any longer, I really don’t want to live anymore. Everyday I entertain the idea of being in a car accident because I want people to take care of me and love me but I also hate that I want that and wish so badly to be okay with not needing validation and approval from others. I attempted to overdose recently and all I thought about was someone finding me dead on the floor and hoping they would feel bad. I couldn’t even think of how this would affect my poor mother who has been through so much with my ungrateful attenuation seeking ass. Im so grossed out with myself. I’m eating at myself and letting myself go, I keep picking and scratching and slapping myself because I don’t think I deserve to get better. I deserve to hurt because I’m a sad sack of shit who has NOTHING to be sad about. I have everything I could ever need in life and I’m still complaining like an ingrate. I fucking hate myself so much, there is someone out there who deserves my own life more than I do. I’m going to start antidepressants I was prescribed re cently and am in therapy (I don’t go as often as I probably should) and while that is good, I’m almost scared of getting better just to get worse again. I’m scared of going on antidepressants because I’d rather feel so much than feel nothing at all which is my predicament. If this doesn’t work, if I keep waking up depressed and if I continue to get worse, I really want to just die. I have no friends, they all live far away and I think they only care because I think they can tell I’m depressed based on some statuses I’ve posted. My boyfriend continues to be loving towards me, but I always feel like he only does now because he doesn’t want to hurt me. He says he wants me to get better and be more confident, and I can’t help but feel that maybe he deserves someone who is more confident. He reminisces on the past and is always talking about wanting to travel and I can’t help but feel so bad thinking that I won’t be involved in those plans because I’m not a fun person to be around. People have reassured me that I am more than enough but I’m not, I’m not I don’t believe them. They’re just saying that I hate myself so much",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Thinking of quiting my job I work as a waitress and it's killing me inside. I have anxiety along with depression and having to answer phones, greet customers, small talk etc is just exhausting for me. I also don't get along with some people there. My boss and the chef mainly. I get really anxious the entire day beforehand (work evenings) and it just puts me in a bad spot. Another reason for wanting to quit is I'm currently a student and I'm in the last leg of my final year dissertation, I just don't want the stress of having to go deal with my boss and having to take orders etc when I have this important deadline coming up. The only problem is it's my only income.

"Post: Failure to trust ‘’those on my side’’. [possible trigger Warning] I find myself incapable of trusting my spouse. I’ve been with my SO for nearly 15 years, 7 married this year, we have 3 children. Before I hit my mid-teens I’d been through nearly a decade of sexual abuse within the already dysfunctional household I grew up one, with an alcoholic father and a narcissistic mother. I met my now spouse when I was 17. He had been in a two year relationship with a girl a few years his senior, which left him broken after her infidelity. And I… well I lived day to day, carrying what I could. I’ll never forgot how I coldly and factually told him with a mere two sentences what I had to endure, telling him that if he did chose me, he would be settling for a lifetime shared with a woman with severe ups and downs due to her limited mental strength. He convinced me to go for it and I wept in his arms. That was probably the first time in my life someone did not look the other way and I allowed myself to be vulnerable, instead of distant and cold. I opened myself up to him. Few years later my home situation imploded. I ran. His mother took me under her wing, I think she was the first parental figure I could lean on in my life. His father loathed me as the girl from the slums, threatening me in private to never marry his son. Reminding me of my lowly descent when he could. He would never come to accept me fully but at least fully respects me in public, which to me is commendable enough. Afterwards I started living with my now SO, still during our teens in a studio. The idea was triggered and pushed for by me as a solution after a bout of infidelity on his side after he moved to study in a city a couple hours away. He partook in intimate relations with a girl he knew from another country over webcam due to ‘’loneliness’’ and held the act in the same regards as watching porn whereas I didn’t. We tried to work things out. As we did my view of him started to crumble, but was rebuilt after living together surprisingly worked remarkably well. We grew more towards each other and were best friends on top of lovers. In between this life changing chapter and where I am now, he has had a few strikes I simply can not forget. While I was once open to share my ups and downs and sadness with him, now I’d rather not. Because where I once trusted him to hold me, I now trust him to ridicule me and tell me to man the fuck up. And the stubborn ass I am, I do, but this comes with resentment. But to explain the strikes: - One is where I was crying after having particularly bad and involuntary memories. Annoyed by my state and stressed by upcoming finals he asked me: When is this going to end? You’re always spinning the same old tales, you’re driving yourself insane. - Another was when he screamed out while we had visitors: How would you like it if I told everyone you were raped? He believed I had done something utterly despicable, blame was pinned upon me by one of his siblings. In that moment something broke, the attack was 100% unwarranted. So much trust lost. When he figured out I had done nothing to him the apologies came swift and numerous. - One was when I asked him for a letter. He will always buy flowers on special occasions, which I hate. They wither and die. I just hate the sentiment, I dislike it and I have communicated this. I wanted something which lasts. A reminder. All I wanted was a letter. Years I secretly yearned for one but received flowers instead, which I still tended to. Finally… I asked for a letter. He refused and told me point blank to my face he would not. That it was silly I needed something to hold onto, and that this item would become something of an unhealthy obsession. - The latest strike was after I endured a panic attack while I was on my own, which I managed myself before he returned home. He was upset when I confided in him and he stated: I will not be on your side if you are mentally ill. I will choose our children and make sure they grow up with stability. (Later he corrected himself and stated that if I was to turn schizophrenic or manic, he would have me committed and divorce me, but would support me through depression and anxiety). Now to me a panic attack is something manageable if you are equipped to deal with it. Through the years I have learned to be aware of my surroundings and triggers and to be prepared to deal with anything since I am responsible for my children. I have no history of hysterical or erratic behavior, so I found his reaction to my first ever panic attack very… crude. I have my pride even through my depression for what I have survived and what I have accomplished. But I hate that I can not find it in myself again to open up towards my spouse and more than often find myself crying when I am capable to, so I can put up my smile and brave face when I NEED to. I’ve successfully faked it till I made it. And of the 15 years that we have been together the good by far outweighs the bad, something which can not be conveyed well enough in this post. But what has been said can be never taken back. Even though recently he said: Don't you understand after 15 years I am on your side? I",reddit_train.csv
"Post: My mom mocks my depression to her friends My mom doesn’t believe I’m depressed even though all the psychologists I’ve been to so far tell her I am - and i KNOW myself that feeling like I want to kill myself all the time isn’t a healthy mindset.

She calls me lazy and ungrateful, complains about how I don’t do anything productive and sit around all day, I don’t eat much if anything. She treats me so awfully and if I retaliate in the same way all of a sudden I’m the bad person. And here’s the worst of it: I heard her talking about me to her friend, laughing and mocking me, saying stuff like ‘oh everything is always wrong for her, poor girl! she says shes depressed but i know she’s making it up for attention so she doesnt have to do work around the house like the lazy bitch she is’ It crushes me even further and at this point I don’t know what to do. I want to kill myself but I have so many goals and aspirations for the future. I’m stuck in this position between so badly wanting to live and so badly wanting to die.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Thoughest time of my life, and honestly i cant show it So i meet this girl for nearly 2 years ago. I'd say we are probably more then best friends, we are soul friends. For over a year we talked about me moving to their town, so i can get closer to her, her husband and her kids. We have literally been talking for nearly 2 years straight. I understand that she is getting abit tired of me now, but i just moved 1 week ago and she has bearly talked to me once. She is so busy playing video games right now, the only one that really has helped me this past week is her husband. I feel i moved so far for nothing, and now its KILLING me. and since i wont have internet for a while, im getting bored out of my mind, and my depression is hitting me so hard.. I did confront her about this though, but she keeps saying she is depressed and the only way for her is to play games. Even tho when i play games, she keeps going to private worlds with friends, and whenever i as for an invite, she ignores it, even tho it pops up a big icon on her face. My life has been so hard lately, my mom lost her kids in court, other then that, my stepdad made an false accusation of me doing stuff to a child becasuse he is a fucking moron and wanted to ruin my life for fun. (And no, i didnt do anything to a kid just FYI). I won the case but it was ever lasting 3 years.. Other thatn that ive been bullied for 15 years, i've lived alone for since i was 16. Aswell im a very VERY jelous guy, so im not gonna deny that, and here is one of the issues with this: MY EX fucked my life up with cheating on me, and since then i have big trust issues, aswell i tend to get very jelous now when my best friend is getting new friends and seems to have more fun with them then me. Tho, i know my best friend would never leave me since she wanted me up here anyway, but the jelousy that she is having such a good time with others are ripping my life apart. The past 5 Months has been depression only, and Honestly if people has gone through as much as me these past 5 months with suicidal thought every day, they would of gone mental. I have a very strong mind, so it takes alot to take me down mentally, but for some reason, im lost and i dont know what to do. Half of the time i just wanna sit and cry. Before i was friend with her, i had a depression but it wasnt that bad. I didnt have friends then so i didnt have to go through what i have now, For some reason i feel like im not designed to have friends, that my life should keep going on the PC without real ""friends""",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Girlfriend attempted to break her arm to avoid going to work My girlfriend began her summer job in a hospital earlier this summer where she mostly cleans and prepares meals for the patients. She has been pretty upfront about the fact that she is stressed during the days and doesn't want to go to work most days. Since we don't live together we see eachother about three times per week although less during summer since work prohibits that to an extent. She has never during our two year long relationship showed any signs of self harm nor depression. However, today i saw her for the first time this week and I noticed bruises on her fore arm. She unwillingly explained that she had tried to break her arm in order to not have to go to work anymore for the rest of the summer. She said that she had had a panic attack and in desperation smashed her arm into a metal pole in order to break her arm. She promised to let me know if she felt that way again but I am not sure if she is going to. She also made me promise to not tell anyone about it. How can I help prevent her from harming herself another time? What other things are there that I should be aware of concerning her well being?

"Post: Friend Abandonment Issues Hey Reddit. Im having some friend issues. I(M33) have a friend(M34) who I was close with for years who now seems to abandoning me. We met each other 10 years ago. We hit it off and would casually hang out with eachother. He was new to the city so I ushered him into the fold of my friend group.We both had similar tastes and sense of humor. It would work out good and we would have a great time. After a couple years he totally cut off contact with me and those friends. I was confused but didn't mind so much then because I wasn't super close with him. I was confused but not hurt. A couple years after that I reached out to a bunch of people because I needed help moving. I was pretty desperate and couldn't afford movers so I reached out to him as well. To my surprise he responded and came and helped. I was so happy he offered to help and was happy to see him again. After that, we started hanging out again. I asked him what happened and why he broke off contact and he shared with me things about being depressed and hanging out with other people. It felt I little strange but I accepted it and carried on being his friend again. We both moved to a 'big city' through our jobs and work and would meet lots of different people and introduce each other to new friends. We would periodically check in with each other and see how each other are doing, even if we couldn't hang out for weeks on end. We were in a band for a while, threw parties and events. We both went through break ups with our long time partners at different times, and helped each other out in that regard. We basically became 'close friends' and expressed this to each other. Then I introduced him to a group of old friends of mine who recently moved into the city. They all began to hang out with him and it was all good. He even hooked up with one of those friends and have been together for years. I too found a partner I have been with for a a couple years now. Now, over the past couple years he has began to hang out with all of those friends and much less of me. He hardly ever reaches out to catch up or hang out. Months will go by. I try to reach out and stay in touch with him but he does not reciprocate. I had been dealing with this over the past couple years now. I finally called him that I feel a little hurt and that it feels like he doesn't reach out or try to stay in touch- or care for that matter. His response is ""I'm just too busy"" sort of answer. I can also see on social media that he does hang out with other people- mostly the friends I've introduced him to. I feel really hurt by this. I don't understand why he all the sudden doesn't seem to care about me. I don't feel like I have any good friends I can go to anymore. Other close friends have done the same. I have had other friends that I became pretty close with who later I feel like started to treat me like they were 'too cool' to hang out with me anymore. I start to feel less respected and cared about. I'll ask them about things they're doing in their lives and won't be asked the same questions in return. When I do put forward information about things is my life I feel like they're less and less taken seriously or completely indifferent to it. Here's the other thing that confuses me: Some of these friends years later come out of the blue- if I run into them or they start commenting a ton on fb post and act like nothing happened and sometimes they are eager to hang out again. It makes me feel like all the sudden I've done something cool enough, or are hanging out with people they are interested in and want to join in. I don't know whether to ignore them or try to let things go and be friends. My fear is that if I do, we may become close again and they will just do the same thing. Im very confused why this happens. I don't know if I'm doing something to encourage this. When I say 'close friend' I do not mean calling every day or even every week and sharing every aspect of each other lives. Close friend just means some one you can talk to every once in a while, and who checks in to see how the other is doing. Is that asking for too much? I feel envious when I see how my girlfriend has couple good friends she talks to about her life and issues. I think it's healthy to have close friends other than your significant other you can do this with, I just don't understand why I can't hold close friends. Any advice would be welcomed. As a side note: since this has happened with my 'close friend' I have tried to widen my net and reach out to other people to hang out. I am becoming extremely exhausted. At age 33 now, I feel it is so difficult to try to hang out with other people. I feel like I do all the reaching out and it's making me feel extremely bitter about friends and relationships. I understand about casual friends, networking, or friends that are united around similar interests. I just get frustrated when that is the only thing that holds people together.

"Post: Are my struggles even legitimate? [rant] I have been wondering that for a long wile, after a friend told me that there life had been worse so I had no right to be the way I am. And yes I have had a better life then a lot but dose that lessen my experience and hardships ? Yes I have a supportive family and yes I have friends that are willing to listen to my bullshit, but dose that really lessen my inner turmoil and trouble with my mind, so I have to be fucking stabbed by my own brother to make it legit ? Yes I know nobody liked school, but did they all make themselves believe it was school or nothing, and when they ended up at a dead and was convinced that there life was over !? Did all kids struggle with basics in school ?! Did every kid end up feeling alone no Mather what he or she did there entire life ?! Did they have to feel so alone and unconnected ?! I know full well that anyone else wold have done a better job in life then me, I know I’m wasted potential and probably will never live up to the standers my brother set before me, don’t you think I know that ?! Don’t you think at eats at me almost every waking moment of my existence?! Am I really that defective that I am just not good enough ?! Just because things are moving forward and good for now doesn’t make my feelings and inner turmoil go away ! Do you think I wanted/want to be this sad excuse of a human being ?! I can’t say anything to anyone, I have learnt that I not only feel alone but I am alone, people just end up getting tired of my shit anyway, so I guess I’ll have to go back to bottling everything inside again, maybe when the glass brakes and I cave i will be free, maybe I will find my freedom in death....idk anymore I just don’t know ....sorry for the long rant and thanks for reading if you did...",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Best guy friend is ignoring me, and I don't understand why My best guy friend ""Jake"" (not his real name) have known each other for 14 years. We are now both 19 years old. Of all the friends I currently have, I've been friends with Jake the longest. We first met in kindergarten. I used to be really chubby and shy when I was much younger, so I got picked on a lot. Jake was my only friend back when I was in elementary school and middle school, and he stood up for me a lot back then. In high school, I started to grow out of my childhood awkwardness, lost a significant amount of weight, and managed to find a small group of friends in my school's anime club. Throughout all this, Jake was a very steady, loyal, and supportive friend, and I'm forever grateful to him for that. We ended up getting into different colleges, both around an hour away from our hometown. Even though things got somewhat busy at times, we kept in regular contact and found time to hang out when we were both in our hometown at the same time. Recently, I met a great guy ""Aaron"" (not his real name) in college. We started dating. I wanted him to meet my friends from back home, so I arranged a time to meet for dinner. During our meetup (I invited 3 friends from high school, including Jake), I noticed that Jake was unusually quiet. He didn't say much of anything during our dinner. I thought it was a bit weird because he is normally really talkative (I'm usually the quieter one in our friendship), so I pulled him aside and asked him what's wrong. He said nothing, so I figured nothing was wrong. That meetup was two months ago. About two weeks ago, I reached out to Jake on Facebook to ask him how things are going and to try to catch up on life. He completely ignores all my messages. I tried texting him to ask if he's mad at me. No response. I don't understand. I feel completely blindsided by this because Jake has never gone more than one day without responding to my messages. A mutual friend told me that she always suspected that Jake liked me, but I highly doubt that. He never showed any signs of liking me back when we were in high school, and he had a couple of girlfriends in high school. He's not the shy type, so I highly doubt he would be the type of guy to hide his feelings for so many years.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Group of friends exclude one person and I’m now stuck I between... So I have a group of about 13 friends, some of us have been friends most of our lives and others have joined over the past 10 years. One friend I’ve always be closest to went though a tough time recently and it was decided by some of the louder group members that she shouldn’t be part of the group anymore as she wasn’t making any effort and she was being a drama queen! (She definitely was not and they were all being extremely judgemental without knowing her full story) I totally disagreed with them and confronted them about it. The loud ones argued back and the others stayed quiet and a few then spoke to me privately later and said they agreed with me. There are a few that I will never again consider a friend going forward! My dilemma is that there are still a good few in the group I enjoy spending time with and would like to remain friends with and I am also friends with the excluded friend! I feel that I either have to leave the friendship group or remain in it and stay quiet about how awfully they treated my friend and put up with the nasty few! Either way I feel awful. I don’t really know the purpose of this post but I don’t really have any other friends so if I break away from this group I wouldn’t have any left apart from the other excluded friend. I’m not sure they really are my friends anymore as they haven’t been there for me recently so I suspect I’d be next on the chopping block anyway.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Relationship with my Dad Hey, I post this as I need help on how to deal with the situation on my relationship with my Dad. Don't get me wrong, I do love him- however I am not sure that I like him to the extent that he likes me. By like, I mean as a ""buddy"" relationship, we have similar interests and we talk about these interests a lot, but his personality irritates me and we have gotten in a lot of arguments, of which I never convince him. I am currently in University, I am living on campus (this is the first time living on my own), and I must say: I am absolutely loving it. Having my first time being independent has made me feel much better. Mainly because I am away from home. I have this thing where I just want to be independent, not influenced by other people's views/thoughts (my Dad mainly). A couple of years ago my Mum and Dad broke up, I stayed with my Dad as I did not agree with what my Mum had done. Me and my Dad were always close as we are both into Gaming and watching TV shows etc... but it is only recently that I have realized I dislike him. My Dad can be quick at losing his temper, he lives by the policy of Honesty (which is a good trait), but at the same time- he is completely contradicting. In arguments we get into, I explain my view and so does he, however he turns my view against me and then later apoligises for not understanding, making sure he will listen better in future. This never happens. This has persisted over the years and it makes me feel uneasy talking to him about anything. I then feel guilty about not wanting to talk to him. Which brings me to my next issue. He talks to me daily. Once in morning, some points during the day and then at night. I understand this is his first time living alone too, but I need my space and it is physically and mentally draining having to talk to him. Especially as I feel forced to keep the conversation going. Pretty much the majority of the conversation is me talking about my day, my thoughts on things and anything interesting that happened. He briefly mentions his stuff, but then there is silence. I try to keep the conversation flowing, but it does NOT feel natural at all. It is not like the conversations I have with my friends or other members of the family. Which again, makes me feel guilty when I want to hang up. I really have tried to change my perspective. It is getting close to moving back home (I am a first year student) and will be commuting from my home town to University for the upcoming years at Uni. I am really not looking forward to this. I am enjoying spending time AWAY from home, to avoid my Dad. Now I am going to have to live with him for the next few years. Now I do love him, and he does everything for me. He is trying to pay off my Student loans so I feel comfortable, and I have been saving for my deposit that I will put on a house after my time at Uni. But the issue is, I really want independence. I feel guilty that I want to live in the city where my Uni is and work to pay joint rent with friends. This way I learn the world of work, but that comes with having higher stress as I'd have to work and study. Which is what my dad doesn't agree with. And trying to explain to him that I want to learn the world of work does not compute with him. As rationally speaking, there are many more benefits of me commuting. And I cannot win, I really can't. He wants me to get the best oppotunity I can in life, and make sure that I get my Masters. But, he is deciding and forcing my path for me. I feel restricted and it makes me feel down most days for each time I have to talk to him. It just reminds me of the next 3 years being stuck at home with him, him thinking we have this great relationship where I just prefer literally anything else. Thank you.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Post graduation depression is real. It's been 5 months after graduating from college and I've never been depressed more than ever. Unemployed and feeling worthless. Parents are forcing me to get a job already, Peers landed their dream jobs / found a job that pays well and earning more money than me. The feeling of being worthless is overwhelming. Crushing. While unemployed, I've finished a free short course on graphic design and got my certification after passing the assessment and currently doing one on web development. I want to learn more skills in order to land a good job. But I don't think my parents would understand, as they want me to get a job already, any job (Customer Service Representative jobs are a trend in our country which most of fresh graduates end up, I'm not detesting that kind of job but it ain't my thing). I'm depressed more than ever. Fucking anxiety. I've been avoiding my peers because I don't want them to see me unemployed and broke. I'm anxious because I don't think I'm worth it and anxiety had been a problem for years. I'm depressed because of the pressure my parents are giving me. I'm mad because nobody understands me. I'm sad because I don't have anybody. I'm afraid because I might end up a loser in the end. I'm a mess because of the all of the above. (God.

"Post: Dear reddit, happiness isn't a choice for everyone I'm sorry but I need to get this off my chest in a place where people will understand me. Dear people that think happiness is a choice, it's not. Me or my fellow sufferers don't choose to be miserable. In fact if it really was that simple, I'm sure 99% of us would choose to be happy without even having to think. I feel sad because I have mental illness. If you don't know, that means my brain isn't normal. My brain has deficiencies and such that keep me from feeling happy, even when I should. I'm so sick of reading replies to mine and other people's post about depression that try to oversimplify a serious mental illness that can cause suicide. I swear everyone on this website assumes we do nothing to try to help ourselves. I really can't believe people are that misinformed that they really think that many people choose to be that miserable. You wouldn't choose to be miserable if you had the choice, and so would we. But we don't get that choice. Then we have comments like ""Just put a life together that wont make you depressed"". I think these piss me off the most.

"Post: Should I attempt to repair our friendship one last time? So a few months ago a close friend and I had a sort of fight because I made a shitty passive aggressive comment. I apologised shortly afterwards and felt terrible about it, even apologised more a day later. Anyhow they said they needed some space, we happened to work together and sit right next to each other. So I left them be for awhile, they basically refused to even look or speak to me. After a month or so this started to take its toll on me, emotionally and mentally I wasn't equipped to deal with it. So eventually after 66 days of this, something I could not get away from I snapped and out of desperation as I was losing my mind I told I'm walking away as without communication the friendship is doomed. So that's where it ended, they then carried on ignoring me for the rest of our time at work, they eventually left to go to a new place. Even at the farewell I was ignored till the last 10 minutes then got some communication. After that a couple weeks later on my birthday they randomly wished me a happy birthday on a work group. Completely unexpected, sadly this confused the shit out of me and I drunkenly sent some message about being tired of all the hurt. Then I was blocked. I have since not contacted them in any way for over a month. Do I make another attempt and how would I word it or should I just leave it and see if anything happens, we were really close and I feel awful about hurting them.

She was absolutely terrible toward me when we were in high school, such as defacing my sketchbook, purposefully kicking my food away, sending me fake ""love letters"", and more. Anyway, the bully now had two children (I'm having trouble conceiving so that stings), and I think the bully could smell my fear because she headed right to my counter, and began to make a show of how expensive everything was in our store while also ""catching up"" by telling me about how successful she is with her self made interior design business.

I let him into my head to the point I feel brainwashed. I hate everyone. I don't trust anyone. I don't want to talk to anyone because I know he will get mad and be jealous. He is the closest and only person I have in my life and even though we broke up he wants us to remain best friends. We dated for 2 years and it was Rocky the entire time.

I am 26 years old and I have 0 friends other then him. I am terrified of being alone. But he is seeing someone else now. She is 100 times better then me in every way. She is super model gorgeous and everything that me and him shared she has as well. I feel replaced. But I don't want to not be his friend and not have him in my life. I'm terrified to lose him.

My thought process is like this: when I wake up and feel like dying, at least the spilled coffee gives me something to do in the mean time.

"Post: Just graduated university. Anxious and depressed, can't find a job, scared of losing partner over it Hi everyone. This is my first post on Reddit. I just felt like I needed advice from people who might understand. I'm in my early twenties and just graduated with a bachelor degree in psych in October. I never really had a job during that time because I was lucky to have my school and expenses paid for and I wanted to focus on school. I've only had one job but it was 5 years ago just at a fast food place. My boyfriend of almost 4 years and I live together. He has a great job and pays for 2/3 of our expenses and I pay the rest. He's recently told me he doesn't see a future for us if I don't get my life together and find a job and start putting more into the relationship. I feel this is coming at a bad time because ever since I graduated I am really anxious and depressed. I find it hard to even get up in the morning, chores get neglected, I don't even want to get out of the safety of my bed. The world is bleak and I'm sad all the time. I can't sleep all night and then sleep till mid afternoon. I feel like my life is just staying home and having to do chores and feel sad. I try to apply to entry level jobs like cashier at the grocery store but no one calls back. I don't know what to do because I want to get better and don't want to lose my bf but I can't even get an interview to work at a high school level job.

"Post: I went to College for Political Science. Now I can't stand politics. When I started college in 2012, my goal was to join the foreign service to represent my country to people abroad. I loathe Trump and all he stands for. My grandmother lost every single relative in Europe to the Nazis, and two days after the election I saw another student at the University come in wearing an SS logo. And with Nazis marching every month I am am ashamed to be American. I have been running behind in college for a while, but as long as I had serving my country to look forward to I kept going. At this point though I would rather be dead than associated with this country. I can't even avoid the toxicity of politics because that is what my degree is in. I spent the last year trying as hard as I could to think of any reason to keep going. I can't find one. I wrote my first suicide note last month all about my feeling of meaninglessness in a country that killed the country I loved. While I wallowed in self loathing, I have costed my mother so much money. Once my sister started college she had to cash out her 401k to keep us both in college because I didn't get a scholarship and didn't graduate. I would get a job, but I don't have a driver's license and public transportation doesn't go by my house. When I drop out of school my student loans will come due, and if I can't pay them my family will try. The only way out I can think of is death. My student loans are of a type that are forgiven if I die, so my family would save more by just paying to have me buried than to pay off my debt.",reddit_train.csv

She got cancer three years ago along with other illnesses and suffered a great deal. I was the only one here to help. Her last year and a half was very tough and I was her full time caregiver. I gave up a everything. As a business owner I Lost most my clients, compiled a mountain of debt and now I am alone to care for her house ( I gave up my place) and pay the mortgage. One sibling says it's unfair that I got more then twice him. The conversation killed me because I think he is hurt by it and I feel guilty. My mom told them before she died that I got the lions share but he says he didn't think it was this much of a disparity. I don't know what to do or how I should feel. She always told me she had her reasons. Part of me thinks that fair isn't always equal and I want to tell him that. At the same time I don't want to feel entitled or like I deserve something more. I don't know what to do if anything. I don't feel like I should give them some of my inheritance. I guess I am looking for a little validation and a little advise. side note: I don't think insurance companies and retirement funds should reveal the total policy or amounts and beneficiaries payout percentage.

"Post: Fucked up Families- Mamas From Hell We all got that fucked up incident in our families, right? Well, Imma vent about mine, cause it real fucked. For me at least, right, so am a naive virgin eighteen year old, wanna yknow experience sex and dig a guy and stuff, so I go on the dating apps and meet a lad, real nice too, sweet and that, I obviously am attracted to him. So we date and do all the couple stuff like movies and sex and I am on cloud nine cause he an older man so like am cool at school (super super shallow and lame but yknow, naive virgin eighteen year old trying to live up to social pressures exerted by my peers). Anyway, I like the dude, and we fall for each other, we married now with kids so we chill. Right, so a month or two in, he gets all funny on a night out and makes us go somewhere quiet away from our mates, which I dont catch onto cos yknow am like shitfaced and cant feel my face so I dont realise nothing is up at all. Right so he says to me, I shagged a girl before you and am like dude thats not a surprise yknow you told me you had women before me. That shit fair enough cause hes older and yknow its normal for partners to experiment before settling for one. And he goes well I like you, a lot, and I dont want this girl to ruin shit and am like, well I dont see how you arent still shagging her are you? he isnt still shagging her right, so yknow good boy, however, he shagged her before me, like six months before me and yknow what can happen in six months? A goddamn baby can grow in the mofo womb during that time. Hes pissed, he was like I told her it was a shag, she agreed, told me she was on the pill and it mustve glitched that month (as the story always goes) and she got preggaz. I told her to terminate (dude this is a condensed version of the story, there was emotion and shit behind it, so dont go all prolife on me, it's just a minor detail im trying get out there and passed so I can tell the rest of the story). Right, so she starts kicking off saying hes emotionally black mailing her into an abortion and talking about a baby she lost as a teen and shit and am like, okay so just back off. He did, and she came back a few months later like lol theres another guy, not sure if hes the dad or not, I think its you tho. Like, good, thanks bitch, a think its you is all the proof I need. So she sends him laods of scans and basically pretends hes her baby daddy. Annoyed me a bit cos yknow i was a teen wanting to mess round and just yknow settle with this guy and this chick is trying to like worm her way in. She makes friends with his sister on fb (weird cos he doesnt have contact with any of his family, hasnt for like four years prior that) and starts getting pally with his mum dad brothers, all of them. Tells them I was his mistress and they were a couple, they decided to have a baby, and when she got pregnant he started messing round with me, a teenage girl. Fews holes in that story but well skip ahead, and the baby is born. They get this dodgy dna that says its not admissable in court due to infrequencies or something and that close relatives (she was shagging his brother at the time too) could skewer results. Basically the baby daddy could be his bro but itll come back his cause its a shit dna. Anyway it came back the baby was his and he suddenly goes all fatherly. Doesnt see the kid for like six months then starts visits and pays maintance. Meanwhile, shes fucking round going to his family and bitching about how horrible I am being a homewrecker and all that eventho they were a shag and got with him six months after her. He wont get another dna cause he was like paid for one not doing another, and I explained the issues but he wont. ALl our children look identical, the kid has blond hair and blue eyes, me and my partner are both dark and so are our kids, (the girl in question also is dark so where the fuck blond blue eyes came from is beyond me). For months after she kept ringing me saying omg you need to put him on the phone the babys sick and he needs to visit, and if you ignore it shed up it and be like an ambulance is coming now omg its serious (it never was). The kid was in hospital like twenty times in his first week of life, each time let out with nothing serious wrong, altho she exaggurated and made out he was on the brink of death. Tries to get him to take her kids out while Im in mofo labour, giving birth and shes kicking off on the phone saying hes not spending enough time with them. Once I gave birth comes round screaming and shouting how hes off the birth certificate, how shes changing the kids name and how shes taking him to court for more money yhadda yhadda yhadda. Mama from Hell, legit worst parent and just a nightmare to deal with, the shit that baby been through already, feel sorry for it. Your mamas from hell?",reddit_train.csv
"Post: How to drift away from a 'best friend' you don't like anymore? I have a friend, and I am trying to put distance between us. They're generally a nice person (but do some mean things occasionally), but they're quite... boring. Okay, very boring. I don't even know how I have been able to put up with the lack of interesting conversation for the past 2 years. I need a best friend with whom I can laugh about fun stuff and not just talk about SCHOOL. Let's call them B. B has clung to me for the past 2 years, so they don't have any other friends. I have loads of other friends, but they all assume that I'm best friends with B, so they don't make an effort to include me in their friendship group. I've told quite a few of them, and they are giving me some advice on what to do, but I want to see what all of you say. For the past few weeks, I have been making it quite clear that I don't really want to talk to B. I give them short answers as replies, don't make eye contact or initiate conversations and I have generally been ignoring them. I know it sounds mean, but I've had enough. I can't deal with clingy people. However, B is either EXTREMELY OBLIVIOUS, or they are just being really stubborn. Also, even though I am ignoring B, I sit next to them in lots of lessons, and I also hang out in the same room as them at break and lunch so they always come and shuffle next to me! SO. INFURIATING. I don't want to change rooms, because then I won't be with my friends. Another thing is that if I ignore B, I actually look like a loner. I ignore them by being antisocial in the corner doing my homework most of the time. I mean, everyone in my school already thinks I'm sort of weird child that studies all of the time, because I always seem to be studying at school (which is actually because I don't do anything at home). I also have to eat by myself at lunch, and having social anxiety definitely doesn't help with that. I know I shouldn't care about that, but it's hard not to. I went off on a tangent there, didn't I? So basically, what I'm trying to ask you is that should I completely completely ignore B (e.g. don't talk to them at all) or is that too mean? (Please don't suggest anything that says to try and be friends with them, because I don't want to do that. I want to make exciting friendships that I will remember, and not be stuck with... a boring person. Also, I'm 14. I don't know if that will help, but meh.) B has turned into one of those people that... you just want to punch in the face for no reason. Do you sort of get what I mean? Anyway, thanks for listening to this ranty thing.

We got our results back last week. I said yes to see family relationships. Turns out I have a cousin in the system. She reached out to me for information but I didn't even know she existed. Her bio mom says they she isn't ready to be in contact with her. From what I gather it was a teenage pregnancy and my grandparents forced her to give up the baby , moved her to a house for unwed mothers and moved the whole family away from their hometown to avoid embarrassment . I think it was a very traumatic experience for her and she may not want to bring up those memories. I feel stuck in the middle now and don't know how to deal with the situation. I suffer from social anxiety and this whole situation has caused me panic attacks. I feel bad for my newly found cousin and don't want to break her heart but I can't go around my aunts wishes. I don't have a lot of information about the family that I could pass on without talking to my aunt or other family members.

"Post: Nightmares and dreams HI, I don't know about you, but when I was a kid I used to have this weird nightmares (not the teeth fell out usual nightmares) Like getting lost in a winter forest in pijamas just to be eaten up by wolves, being totally awake at my bed while insects ate me alive ( like sleep paralysis but dreaming?) or just watching my mother being eaten by feral dogs as she protected me. Anyway, as I grew older and my depression grew with me, I stopped having nightmares, I can barely recall when the last one was. Instead I have pretty vivid dreams (not lucid ones) and in most of them, I'm at some kind of weird scenery where I feel like I've always been there, and weird shit happens that I can remember, and it's like a full story, a lot of different things happen in the same dream. The problem is, in most of them, I meet someone, normally a girl, with which I start a mutual relationship after overcoming some hardship, like, my biggest desire. These dreams, as good as they sound, are worst than the nightmares because when I wake up, it takes some time to realize that I did not live that shit, that I'm still in bed, and I'm still alone.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: According to the mental health nurse i'm not depressed So since october 2016 i've been (or at least thought I had) been depressed. I dropped out of school, started self harming and was put in hospital twice among other things. I spent nearly the whole of 2017 at home doing nothing because I simply couldn't. I got a full time job in september but I hated it and it made me worse and I had to quit after I started self harming again and have been cutting up until now (i'm 18 by the way if that's important). Things have been getting worse again recently. I'm cutting almost every night and feel down and just cant do anything. I don't even have the energy to shower most days and just stay in bed until the late afternoon. However I was hopeful for today as I was going to see a new nurse who I was hoping would be able to set up a plan to help me. I was with the child services before and had an amazing nurse who helped me greatly but as i'm 18 i'm classed as an adult so have to go to the adult services. So as soon as I met the new nurse and we went into the room to talk she told me she knows almost nothing about me despite there being many notes from the past year. I told her about leaving my job and feeling low and the self harm and everything and what she basically told me is ''you aren't depressed''. She said that my self harm was normal as it was just scratches and I wasn't cutting deep enough to leave any scars which just completely confused me considered i'd been put in hospital partly for doing the same thing before. I've also suffered with terrible social anxiety all my life and find it very hard to communicate with others. I told her the only friends i've ever had was the friends I've made years ago when I first started going to school and what she said was it sounds like I have great social skills as i've been able to make friends. It honestly felt like she wasn't listening to a single word I was saying. As I said she had no notes from before and was basically just assuming what was wrong with me and that was it. Also I should add i'm in the UK so this is with the NHS so i'm not paying for this however my parents have said they would be willing to pay for some sessions with a therapist if that's was I need. I'm sorry if this is long or it just sounds like i'm complaining. I just wanted other peoples opinions on this as I just don't know what to think.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: I feel like depression has turned my brain into mush and now I can’t be successful in anything Last year I stopped being productive at work and it’s now seeping into the rest of my life. I used to receive accolades for being great at my job. I was even at the top in the nation at my job when they looked at my metrics and sales. But now I’m just sad all of the time and I can’t think straight. Every morning I wake up I start the day ready to take it on. I tell myself I’m going to be productive and make strides to complete goals. But then I can’t bring myself to do anything. There are days where I can sit at my desk for hours just thinking about how I should be working on something. But then when I try, it’s like I can’t think straight. The things I used to be good at now don’t really seem to make sense to me. I feel like my brain is literally turning into mush. I started seeing a therapist, I started taking anti depressants, I exercised for awhile, I tried meditating, I feel like I’m trying everting in my power to get me mind right. But my brain is mush and now I can’t be successful in anything I do. School is starting to slip and my friends keep asking why they never see me.

"Post: Emotionally offline I shouldn’t be writing this, I have three final projects due in the next couple of days and I haven’t started on any of them. But I don’t have the energy to even get started...I don’t know what to do. It’s too late to ask for extensions but I don’t want to fail my classes (that mean nothing to me). Whatever...I guess I’ll turn out fine because I was doing well grade-wise up to this point, but it’s gonna be fucking painful. Over the course of the last couple of weeks, I feel as if I’ve gone emotionally offline. I feel like a shell of myself. I’m not sure what happened. I think the real downturn started when I was walking on campus two weeks ago and saw my ex-girlfriend of a few months with her new boyfriend, but that’s definitely not the only thing that is bothering me. It might have been a death-by-a-thousand-cuts situation because if I take an itinerary of what’s going on in my life, there isn’t much there. If my life had a thesis statement, it’d be that I have nothing to look forward to. Hardly any aspect of my life can bring me out of the apathy that I seem to be stuck in every day. I don’t find any of my classes enjoyable, and now the thought of doing it as a career is starting to give me nightmares. I have “friends” but I don’t much enjoy hanging out with them, and overall, any attempts to meet new people just seems to amount to nothing. I have no dating life, and I’m still admittedly stuck on the aforementioned ex-girlfriend (who has completely moved on) that I dated for seven months and have been broken up for the same length. All I can think about is that if she saw me today, barely able to get out of bed and go to school, I’m also certain she would feel even more justified in breaking up with me. I keep thinking about this new person she’s dating and in what ways he is likely a complete upgrade. I don’t even know what their situation is, I am just inventing scenarios in my head. I need to stop that. Fuck. The only thing I have is that I’m in fairly good shape and my GPA is 3.8 (although that’s certain to go down after this week, which scares the ever-living shit out of me because it feels like the only real thing I can put on my resume). I’m also fairly consistent with working out; it’s not a huge part of my life, but holy shit, if I didn’t do it I can’t imagine how depressed I’d be. Right now, all of the emotional energy I have for the day goes to getting myself to the gym at the least. With my career, I’m interested in how technology affects people and society; like internet addiction, social media, artificial intelligence, etc. That is kind of what drew me to my major in the first place, which is User Experience Design. However, I do little of that (the research side of things, which includes talking to people and learning their stories, then coming up with conclusions based on that data on how you can improve a digital service) and more the design/development side of things (like visual/graphic/UI design and web development, just building the fucking thing), which I’m good with, but it both stresses me out and bores the shit out of me. I think it’d be fulfilling to be a UX Researcher for a popular social app just because I would be able to study how people interact with it. Or do that for a consultancy/agency or something, and start a blog/podcast about technology+society. I kind of largely detest the Silicon Valley tech utopianism that’s sweeping the country, it seems to be making everyone I know (and myself) unhappy in really subtle ways, but it’s become almost a cult of sorts. I could turn what I learn about user research to that. But if I want to keep pursuing this path, I have to keep doing the parts that make me depressed (design and coding) for a significant amount of time so I’ve just kind of lost motivation to try at all. I know I should just push through, but I’ve pushed through my whole life and honestly, I’m tired of fucking pushing. Everyone is telling me to keep moving forward because I show talent in it (the design/code side of user experience) and it’s lucrative but fuck man I can only do this for so long. I’d rather use my creativity on music or writing. I have three internship interviews this week which isn’t good to have hanging over my head when I’m asking all of these questions. I constantly wonder if there is a better, more fulfilling, and less depressing route to the other side of all of this. The social life issue is more simple, I don’t even want to write about it. I need to be more vulnerable to people and go outside my comfort zone, and that’s gonna take a ton of work no matter how you spin it. The first part of this video with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem is basically my entire life in a nutshell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYCz06bS380. Ditto on the dating life, although that might be a little more complicated. I’ve only even felt attracted to one person since my breakup, so I guess there is more going underneath the surface there. I can’t imagine dating anyone in my current state, but man, the ever-present loneliness really drains me. Isn’t it ironic though? I want to go into a career where I study people all day, yet I struggle to actually build and establish friendships. I’m like a people’s introvert, it makes no sense. I seem to use daydreaming and fantasizing as an escape. I spend an embarrassing amount of mental time",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Things that I liked about today so far **Maybe the only way to escape depression is gratitude. Cicero, one of the senators of Rome in the early days of the empire is quoted to have said ""Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others."" I liked waking up early and going to the gym on an intense pre workout. I like stepping outside in the cold to smoke and feel the warmth when I re-enter the building. I like seeing the trees trying to survive the winter, how splendorous they are. In them I see people going through hard times and the beauty that exists within them. I liked logging on to Runescape to escape reality for a couple of hours and talking to my friends on there. The fact that we have escapes is an amazing thing. I liked seeing three girls meet each other outside and say ""Hiiii how are youuuu?"" and compliment each other. Instead of normally being irritated by that, I actually admired that people in reality share bonds and happiness with each other's presence, and it made me happy to see that. I like the complexity of the mathematics that I'm doing and the fact that I'm doing it. I like having a planned meeting with a group of people today for my class presentation in college. I like having a picture of a God who constantly forgives and is deeply saddened by our unhappiness that becomes to hard to bear for some, versus a picture of an angry Colonel with zero mercy. I like the fact that I have a place to resort to to write down the thoughts streaming from my mind. I like the caprese sandwich I'm eating, with melted mozzarella, tomato, red peppers, pesto sauce.",reddit_train.csv

I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I've had a very rough few weeks with finding myself jobless, financially struggling and fighting with my boyfriend that I decided to write this little note in my phone. (The ending is supposed to sound funny, it was the only thing that made me laugh and give me that final push thought of pulling myself out of this horrible hole I was in tonight) Tonight, under a drunken wine induced depression, followed by the realization that someone I trust had betrayed it and lack of anti depressants, i seriously considered slitting my wrists in the bathroom. While sobbing with my hands in my face, trying to figure out who would take care of my son and my unpaid debt, I looked up to see my cat staring at me. She has this stern, mothering expression in her eyes, and we locked eyes for the longest time. She kept my gaze until my sobbing was under control and I really thought about my actions. Maybe she just wanted wet food. I am really bad at remembering to take my meds, and usually the day or two where I forget doesn't have this effect on me, but for the pile of emotional shit dealt to me the last week or so, apparently it did.

"Post: Falling back into it I'm 16, and this weekend, I got into a big argument with my girlfriend of 7 months. We hadn't seen each other in 2 weeks, and our plans to see each other fell through. I tried to save our plans, but she seemed disinterested. I was so distraught and caught up in sadness and self-hatred that I, wanting to distance myself from the situation, not just leaving it alone, told her I wanted to break up with her out of sheer emotional irrationality. It turns out I was sadder without her, and she reached out to me to talk soon later. We got back together, and she said she was okay. The way she described the whole situation let me know she understood my plight completely, but I ruined her that day and she's been off ever since. She painted her nails black, screamed at her parents, texted all her friends to tell them how much of a terrible person I was, wrote ""Anon is a piece of shit cunt"" in her bathroom mirror in sharpie, and cried all day from the story she told. I've fallen into a depression of guilt to a magnitude that I haven't experienced since I was a self-loathing near-friendless 7th grader with pent up emotions drowning it all out with video games while tanking his grades, watching the few distant friends get reward after reward, trophy after trophy. I feel like I'm a piece of shit that doesn't deserve to breathe the air on this earth, and I don't know what to do. My parents are very unsympathetic and judgmental and my brother is borderline abusive. My girlfriend is the only one left who understands me. At this point, it's just me who has the problem, as she's gotten over the whole debacle, or so she says. Her mom even said ""ehh, you two were just stressed out teenagers"", but I'm still not convinced. I feel like there's something deeply wrong with me. Is there any advice or words of wisdom that I need to hear? I want to get back to normal.

But now... I just want to be a sloth. I want to sit on the couch and watch TV all day. All motivation I had prior to last week has just gone. I’ve never had anyone this close to me die.

My brother has a multitude of things such as depression, anxiety and anger issues. Recently he has been going to IOP (can’t exactly remember the name, but it’s a step below inpatient care) at a facility and he has shown some progress. I feel like he’s more in touch with how he feels and is working on coping mechanisms better. However he did not go to his session today and that caused problems. He got his check from work today and it would not get deposited, and that set him off into a fit. He started breaking things and getting in both mine and my parents faces, cussing and attacking us. We had a conversation after and he said he tells himself the thing we tell him, such as how he needs to be more rational and more committed to getting better. He also eats unhealthy and is overweight, and I’ve attempted to help him get healthier about a month ago, but he stopped listening to me about. I love and care for him deeply but our family is at our wits end with what to do. I would want to leave him be and let him sort his issues out without us harassing him about it but when he gets violent and angry around the house we can’t sit idly. I’m not sure what the next step is but I’d love to hear advice from anyone. Thanks for listening.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Unstuck yourself I used to be stuck in negative mood and had suicide plan at one point. I didn't see the point of doing anything nor meaning of life itself. One day a light bulb went off. I realize the world is much bigger than any of us could see or imagine from our corner at a given time. We shouldn't refuse to do things just because we don't understand the point. Instead we should celebrate the gift we are given. Just go do things because we CAN! If you are lonely, go talk to a homeless person. You will be surprised how much you could learn. If someone did you wrong at one time, forgive them and live for the future. Life has so much for us to explore. The trick is to start on one thing. Put left foot before right foot, then next ... You will feel better soon once you stop feeling by start doing.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Dead is better than alive imo. I wouldn’t say I feel particularly sad or depressed, as a constant state. It’s all over the place. But I think I do want to die. I choose to believe there’s nothing after we die; no afterlife, no heaven or hell, no reincarnation, or godly ascension. Just a beautiful, peaceful nothing. And it just seems so much better than being alive. When you’re alive, you feel so much. Yes, there’s happiness, excitement, surprise, love. But there’s also sadness, anger, hate, jealousy. Why would I chose to bare such things when death can provide none of these things? All the “good stuff” about living doesn’t weigh out the bad, in my head. A nothingness after death just seems like the better, more rational option. Am I wrong to think this?",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Back pain has brought me to a dark space. I’ve been struggling with back pain for 2 years now and I’m 17. I play soccer (football), and thats all I know, I’ve played my whole life. I don’t have much friends nor other hobbies besides gaming (very mediocre gamer). However, these pass two years have been terrible. Due to my undying love for the sport, I would try to play through the pain. (regret it) Which has only made me worse. I decided my first Summer with back pain that I would not play for a month. Which I achieved with no real results. I passed the time playing Video games. However, the constant sitting probably made my back worse. I played a tournament that same Summer after the month break. 5 games some sort of international tournament. By the end of the tournament my back had gotten so bad I couldn’t bear to move. Despite all this, I somehow got chosen to go to Spain. Few months later I went to Spain at 16, with back pain, played soccer and such but didn’t get noticed. Fast forward to now and I’ve gone a whole season barley playing and still struggle with back pain. Now I’m 17, I’ve gone this whole Summer without much activity just stretching and ab work outs. The Summer is almost over and the realization that I haven’t gotten better is bringing a dark cloud over me. I scream at night out of anger and sadness. I constantly tell myself I want to die(&lt;-Im not sure if this is breaking a rule, sorry in advanced, just tell me and I’ll remove this part), and I cry everyday. I do most of those things in private, when no one’s home (excluding the random screaming I do at night). I don’t want my mom to worry about me like she does my diagnosed depressed big brother, and also her dealing with my little brother’s life (He’s 7). On top of all that my mom is a single mom and barley has time for her own life and gets sad easily. (The sight of my mom sad deeply pains me inside) I’ve always been the one kid that could take care of himself. She has even told me personally that she is glad that she doesn’t need to worry too much about me (only deals with my back pain, she takes me to rehab). I’ve been to the Doctors and have done a MRI, they say its nothing. Just functional. (Whatever that means...) Point is, I’m very sad and I feel like I’m getting worse everyday. I don’t know what to do with my life. The one thing I was good at is now gone. I don’t have any other talents or interest.I feel empty without soccer and I don’t know how to feel it. TL; DR: I’ve played soccer my whole life, got a back injury two years ago and I still haven’t healed. Doctors say its nothing) As a result, I am very sad but I keep it to myself. I’m not good at anything else.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Massively depressed and looking for low-cost help Hi there, I am not the type of person to turn to the internet for self-help, but I'm at a loss about what to do and I feel like I have nowhere to turn. I'm 29 y/o F with a history of depression since age 14. I've been on and off about 3-4 different type of antidepressants and in and out of therapy since initial diagnosis, so neither concept is really foreign to me. I'm looking for a low-cost way to talk about my symptoms, even an alternative to real ""talk therapy"". I was in a MSBP-type situation where as a young adult I was forced into therapy when I wasn't ready, and made to discuss what should have been patient protected information with my family after my sessions, so I'm hesitant to ""get into"" that again after the experience.

"Post: People I love keep dying. I can't take it anymore. On New Year's Eve I got a phone call at 1 in the morning that one of my closest friends died. I didn't believe it. I thought it was a joke. It wasn't. His brother made a post on Facebook letting everyone know. It felt like a bad dream. I couldn't stop crying. I cried at work. I tried to get time off, but they didn't offer bereavement for people who weren't immediate family. I was so distraught that I couldn't go to the funeral. I was afraid to see his body. I hate myself for being so weak. He was 28. It shouldn't be. He should still be alive. Four months later, my grandfather died. We were close. The last time we talked he said ""that's my sweetheart, that's my pride and joy."" I sat with him in the hospital and watched Aubrey Hepburn. We promised to see each other again soon. I saw him a week later in hospice. He was catatonic. I told him it was okay to let go, okay to move on if he was in pain. They say hearing is the final sense to go. He died thirty minutes after I left. On July 1st my mother told me that she's been diagnosed with cancer. They took a biopsy of her lymph node yesterday to see if it has spread there. She is on a month of leave from work. That was the final straw for me, I think. I feel like a shell of who I was before December 31st. I am terrified of the future. I remember when my friend died, I asked myself who I would lose next. I had no idea things would spiral down and down. Everyday is a struggle for me to stay at work. All I want to do is sleep. I have constant migraines (a chronic condition), and the pain paired with the grief is absolute hell. I started seeing a counselor about a month ago, and I like her but she can only do so much. I am on medication, and I have a good support system. But the sorrow is just overwhelming. I feel like this grief is never going to end. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to them. I don't want to lose my mom. I'm not even thirty. I'm not ready to wake up knowing that she isn't with me anymore. I can't take anymore. I have been crying all day. I don't really know what I expect to see from anyone here, but I'm just so lost.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I have my ECT consultation today and I’ve never felt more alone. I have a good support system around me but somehow I’ve never felt more alone than at this moment. Nobody else that I know has had depression as severe as mine, or has ever been in this position where the choices are: be miserable forever, or zap your brain which might seemingly cause permanent memory damage and may not even work after all that. Last night was the first time I’ve felt really suicidal in a while (mostly I’ve just been miserable and haven’t even been motivated to plan my suicide). Why go through all these awful, invasive treatments when I could just end it quickly and quietly and then everyone else could get back to their lives? I feel like an immense burden. I’ve been severely depressed for the better part of 2 years at this point. It has totally disabled me, robbed me of a career I loved, and made most things difficult or unbearable. I’ve tried 7 different drugs to try and get it and my anxiety under control. No cigar. I don’t necessarily want to die, I just don’t want to live, if that makes sense. I feel as if my husband, friends, and doctor are keeping me artificially alive with all these treatments that don’t work, when in reality, I’m that painfully sick dog that needs to just be put down already. I never thought the potential for another treatment would actually make me more suicidal, but here we are. Thanks for reading.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Friend slipping up at work. I talked to her and now she’s creating a bad environment for me. I’ll call my ex friend Mary. We met at work. I really valued our friendship because it’s hard for me to make friends. I had a few hurt me in the past, so I became guarded. Plus, I had to leave behind true ones when I moved away from my hometown 3 years ago. About a year and a half ago, she started dating a new guy. They seemed to have an ok relationship. After a year of dating, they started having problems. Mary spent every lunch hour complaining about him the entire time. She stopped asking me how I was, always steering the conversation toward her bf. I tried to be there for her, hugging her and reassuring her she’ll be ok. She would be like, yeah I know but...then continue complaining about him. She admitted to nagging him, and he eventually got sick of it and broke up with her. She was a mess, crying at work, sometimes not even coming in. I felt bad for her but it was the same thing over and over all the time, and I ran out of stuff to say. Not to be offensive toward women (I am one, after all), but being the environment it is, word about Mary’s breakup traveled fast, and all our coworkers went up to Mary to comfort her. She leaned heavily on four of them, who often came up to her desk and asked if she wanted to talk. Mary stopped hanging out with me and started spending a lot of time with them. Mary would say yes when they offered to talk to her at work and they’d talk for like a half hour or longer (my desk is next to hers, so that’s how I knew). I would also see Mary huddled in the hallways talking to these women a lot. It affected Mary’s work. She started taking on less work (claiming she was overwhelmed) and not being around (she would go off to find one of the women), so the rest of us would be left to answer her calls or speak to her clients on her behalf. Our boss is very hands off and is a poor manager so he has no idea, and my coworkers just excuse Mary because they feel bad for her and don’t wanna tell our boss. But because she and I handle certain cases that only she and I know how to deal with, it’s usually me who’s left to pick up the extra slack. This went on for 3 months. Honestly, if she wasn’t a friend, I might gone to our boss, but I decided to talk to Mary about it. It didn’t go well. She got defensive, denied that she was slipping up, and accused me of being a bad friend cuz I wasn’t there for her during this difficult time. I tried to point out examples of her slipping up and she denied it again. I also told her she wasn’t there for me when my friend committed suicide or my dad had a health scare which left him disabled. She just responded that she was left in so much despair from the breakup that she wasn’t capable of being unselfish enough to be a friend. We both walked away mad. She started ignoring me completely. I didn’t think I was wrong but I still felt bad. As this was around Christmas time, I decided to extend an olive branch by giving her a small Christmas gift and card that just said I was sorry and I hoped she had a merry Christmas. The next day, she said thanks and we’d talk soon. The day after that, she was back to ignoring me. Now she doesn’t speak to me or even look at me, just pretends I’m not there. I can’t say for sure, but I get the feeling that she told our coworkers about our conversation (I haven’t told anyone at work about it) cuz I now get the cold shoulder from some of them, too, when just the day before, we were all ok. They, in front of me, make a show of hugging Mary and offer food to each other but not to me. I even got a dirty look from one of the women, too. Sigh, I don’t know what to do. Any advice?",reddit_train.csv
"Post: My friend is dating my friend's rapist. my friend, let's call her 'b' is very troubled. i've known her for years and she's always had very severe depressive, suicidal and destructive tendencies. recently, it had gotten to the point where our friendship was struggling because it always felt like i had to be looking for her constantly and making sure she wasn't literally running away to commit suicide (and if i wasn't there for her all the time i felt like a bad friend). anyway, she started talking to this boy (let's name him 's') who I knew fairly well for many bad reasons. He was dating b and I's friend (named 'e') for a long period, and tldr, he was extremely abusive and raped her multiple times during their relationship. B was friends with E. Recently, B decided to begin dating S (after lying about meeting him repeatedly over a couple days period). I cut off the friendship but she kept trying to speak to me as I didn;t think she got my point of not wanting to be her friend but I think I've made it more clear in recent messages. It turns out B may have lied about a lot of things (to the point of manipulating me about my trauma, telling me certain people said things about me and didn't like me. she says they definitely said it but the people say otherwise so I don't know who to believe. she has extreme 'stories' that i don't know if are true anymore either). B thinks that me cutting off the friendship is to an extent not fair as it's not my business to make her choose between her now boyfriend and me. I disagree - she is dating our friend's rapist (well not her friend anymore) and I find it disgusting and I can't be friends with her due to this. Mostly, I am paranoid that I am.. well.. wrong. Overreacting, as it's not 100% to do with me - I was friends with him during him and E's relationship but not after I knew of the way he treated her. Do you think I am doing the right thing or should I continue our friendship separately? TLDR: My friend is dating my other friend's rapist.

"Post: How do I end this, or can I fix it? ok, so it's kinda a long story.. but me and my best friend met in high school, we clicked right away, there was this bond ( and kinda still is? ) between us, we would never separate, always talking etc. Still in highschool she cut me out of her life sudendly for a whole year. I dont know why I continue trying to talk to her, but maybe it would have been better for us if it had end there, and eventually she came around and asked to go out with her, we didnt talk at all about that, she just gave me a note saying why she did that, wich honestly didnt tell much except saying she has depression and didnt know what she was doing...She said she always hurts everyone so she cut me out. Years later, we didnt talk that much as before, but were still really good friends, then I started to notice that me or other friends counldn say anything to her if it was something that upset her. Sometimes it was so stupid that she got mad at me because I didnt agree with her opinion over an actor... She would rage in games with everyone, and stop talking.. now the part that hurts me like hell is that she would cut us all out of her life, for like weeks, then come back like nothing happen. She would never tell me whats wrong, if I tried to talk about more serious stuff she would step away again. Eventually I got tired, and told her that we couldnt go on like this. So I stoped talking to her, 2 months later I decided to give another shot, what happen was exactly the same. So I stoped talking again, and I though it was for good, we only talked when we were with all our friends etc. Then I learnt a few months later that she wanted to commit suicide. She actually tried it, said her mom, and was admited to an hospital. I was heart broken, thinking about losing her forever took over my jugdment... So I went to the hospital, and we talk normally. Then after she got out we had a conversation, face to face, about her stoping doing all that to me, she said she was going to try, and promised me, PROMISED ME that she would tell me when something was wrong, or when she would like to be left alone so I didnt worry as much, and that she would talk to me if I ever said something wrong about her. Everything was going great, amazing really. I could tell she was better with her medicine and all, but that only last 3 months. Now she had a problem with a boy she likes or something, pretended that everything was ok, despited her answers said otherwise, and started ignoring me. I was mad and said, some things never change, and she responded to me saying she was a lost cause. I wrote a whole text to her saying I want to be her friend, but that will only work as long as shes honest with me and stops pushing me away... she wanst answered yet. she also never said to me that shes sorry she hurts me, even thoug I say that to her when I hurt her.

I was texting my mom today about several things (husband can get ribs on sale at work for them, MIL invited me and my mom to a play, things my MIL said that irritated me...etc. She was on break at work). At the end, she mentioned my dad is home sick today. Maybe I should call him. So I call him and ask him jokinging why he's sick. He said he has the flu or a cold or something. He stayed home yesterday too. Then he mumbled something offhand about how mom wasn't going to tell me because I never ask them how they are. Do normal parents do/say stuff like that? Won't tell their kid that one if them are sick because they don't ask how they are? It makes me feel terrible but also manipulated. It's not like my mom has never given me the silent treatment because she thinks I don't call enough. The thing is...I HATE small talk. I never ask anyone how they are.

I wouldn't wait til asked to tell my close family/friends if I don't feel well. I also have social anxiety and anxiety in general. These kinds of comments make me want to call them even less. I already feel judged every time I call my mom. And I still get anxious every time my dad calls...thinking he is calling to yell or something. I just CAN'T ask. It literally feel impossible. Like I physically can't get the words out. Comments? Anything to make feel better? I feel down and don't like myself. I don't have any friends to talk to about it either.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I got a job and I made new friends I’ve been sitting on my ass for the last 3 years while my boyfriend supports us both because I could never face my anxiety of job interviews, etc. Some days just getting out of bed is a victory for me. I finally forced myself to try and I got a job! I’ve made two friends so far and I don’t totally hate living right now. Making money and being able to help out is giving me a sense of self worth and I haven’t felt like this in so long. I’m not trying to brag, I’m just proud of myself and no one around me really understands how big of a deal it is. I tried taking a bunch of pills a few weeks ago and I had no idea that I’d be semi (dare I say) happy right now. It can get better ladies and gents, you just have to wait for it, I guess.

"Post: I just really need to vent... For a start, I understand everyone in life are at different levels and that depression and anxiety is different for everyone and I am in no way stating who has it worst or better. I’ve taken hours and hours of training in it and I’m not here to speak or preach about how to help.. In a rare occasion in my life I’m asking for help, guidance, I don’t know the correct word but maybe if I explain myself a bit it may help. This maybe long and I do apologize but I just need to say all of this SOMEWHERE... I’m gay guy that recently moved from a conservative town in Montana to the amazing city of Portland, OR. I came out of the closet the summer going into my freshman year of high school, dealt with a (simply put) shitty childhood while growing up in the Bible Belt of northern Florida, with an abusive father and worrying, even at the age of 7/8 about how my future would play out in this. My mom divorced and remarried a man that doesn’t accept my sexuality personally but supports my life decision and says he loves me. We moved to Montana (my mom, me and him) and I began to feel like I did have a purpose when I was introduced to acting onstage at a local theatre that I fell in love with. Life, for a few years, was amazing but my high school at the time was having a crisis. Unfortunately four students had committed suicide between my freshman and junior year and, with the help of many, started a suicide awareness program in the city and lead that for a year or so. My senior year, literally three days before it started, my military brother committed suicide on base, it was suspected it was also his sexuality. But also in my senior year, near the end of it, I met a man whom I fell in love with (which is what I am getting too, just bare with me). We were able to spend a lot of time together for a month or two before he had to leave to Portland (before I had gone) for a work internship where he would go back home to Brazil once completed. He treats me like gold, and I really mean that, he has been nothing but amazing to me. He flew me out to Portland so I could visit him for two weeks where we fell even more in love. Everything was shattered when he left for home and I also left for an adventure. After I graduated, I had the amazing opportunity to go to the BEAUTIFUL island of Taiwan, where I spent an amazing year learning Chinese (Mandarin), meeting people all around the world, experiencing a new culture for the first time, it was indeed a life changing time for me. But it wasn’t easy for my boyfriend and I. We fought in occasion, texting makes it really hard to communicate emotions, and we only had about two hours out of our days to talk due to the harsh time zone differences. The year went by quite quickly and he surprised me with yet another plane ticket to Portland where he would also land only two hours after I did and we would be together again. It was only for two weeks again but I felt complete... He even proposed on the Fourth of July. He was yanked away from me again soon after and it tore me down. My heart crumbled. My next chapter in life had started once I arrived back from Taiwan and had seen my boyfriend again. I had decided I wanted to move to a Portland permanently, found a decent student housing apartment, enrolled for school, I was excited... now this is where things become a bit much for me and why I’m here today. My, now fiancé, was able to stay with me for a full month this time. Now at this point I’m sure you wonder (if you are still reading), “why doesn’t he move here?,” or “why don’t you move there?” Here’s why: He was on an exchange program when I met him that the Brazilian government paid for. The requirement for that visa is that he must stay in Brazil for two years before he can legally move back into the USA. In other words, he is stuck there while I’m stuck here both separated and both in fear of him being rejected. We applied for the fiancé visa and now we are waiting for the approval. I refuse to move where he lives because of how high the crime rate is and due to Brazil’s economic status, we both agreed it would not be good for a white American target to live in a high crime area. I know I have talked a lot about my fiancé but here is also what is going on on my hands as well that I just was not ready for. Before I moved to Portland, I had to go to urgent care because I had no primary doctor and no money, only Medicaid, which they took. I went three times for small bumps on my hands that turned out to be stressed induced and all three times I went the doctors said “I have no idea! Try using lotions and see what happens!” Nodded their heads and left. Very pointless but when I got the bill I was shocked and confused. I thought my Medicaid had covered it, which it did not because while I was out of country my Medicaid had expired and no one told me about it, therefore I was left with a $600 bill. I heard it off for a while because I had other things to deal with than the bullshit that the hospital was giving me about it. Around this time as well,",reddit_train.csv
"Post: That eternal slumber I’m tired. I’m not here to be saved. I’m nearly 40: have a career, a SO, friends &amp; family who care for me but it will never be enough to keep me around. I’ve been depressed since age 8, my first suicide attempt was at 11 and I’m convinced my life will end by my own hand eventually. I’ve lurked here but never posted. I had to reach out somehow and was not going to call or text the goddamn crisis line. The world sees me as happy and outgoing even when I’m honest about my depression b/c I don’t SHOW it to anyone. I’m lonely. I’m tired. I’m not sure how much I have left to give. I try. I do. I wake up &amp; try to be positive, make the most of each day but I’m just going through the motions. That siren’s song has been stronger these past few weeks. Tonite ended with me locked in the bathroom, sitting on the floor in a fat, disgusting, pathetic crying heap - razor blade in hand. One of my cats scratching at the door &amp; me trying to hush her so as not to wake my SO. Through the tears I pathetically sliced away at my inner leg a few times. Been a decade since I’ve cut.

"Post: Is my dad enabling my mom? I have posted on multiple subs about my turbulent relationship with my mom, and I feel like I am afraid of her. I've gotten to a point where I jump when the garage door opens and she comes home from work. I think have become so irrationally afraid of my mom, that fear manifested today when I was going to pick my brother up from work and saw my mom coming the other way. I freaked out and ended up rear-ending another car, totaling mine (I am not hurt, don't worry.) Needless to say, this whole situation has caused chaos in my house and I am terrified to ever get behind the wheel again. Tonight my dad called me out on me calling my mom ""abusive"" a few weeks ago. Bear in mind, neither she nor my dad has ever laid a finger on me, but my mom has emotionally abusive tendencies. She has said things to me that have fucked me up more than she can understand. Here's a short list of some things she's done: * If guilt tripping were an Olympic sport, let's just say she'd be Michael Phelps. * She likes to ask me what's wrong when I'm upset and when I tell her, she cuts me off and says ""I don't want to talk about it."" * She has criticized my weight for as long as I can remember. In her defense, her two sisters are 500 pounds apiece will both probably die before they reach 60, so she just wants me to be healthy and live long. But she's not helping. She's only making me want to cry into a Chipotle bowl. * She liked comparing me to my best friend in high school (""Why can't you be more like her? She studies and gets good grades!"") Still does sometimes. * To this day, she pesters me about my lack of religion. I remember when I was 11 and didn't want to go to Sunday School, she was like ""Do you want to be a heathen and go to hell?"" A couple years ago, she told me ""I just want you to go to Heaven when you die."" She even pestered me a week ago about having demons in my head. * I thought I could confide in her about my sexuality but she quickly shot me down with ""How do you know? You've never been on a date before. That doesn't mean you're bi/gay!"" She also told me I am asexual and she's pretty much gaslighted me about my sexuality to the point where I don't know whether I am gay or straight anymore. * I was diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD when I was a kid and she's basically used that diagnosis to keep me in a little bubble. I didn't get drivers' license until 18, didn't get my first job until 20, and I'm still perpetually single... all because my mom has used my diagnoses as a crutch. She still does, and after the accident, I don't fucking blame her! Whenever I try to tell him about the things my mom says, he says things like ""What's wrong with motivating you to get better grades?"" or ""Your mom doesn't want you to end up like your sisters that she is going to bury because they're 500 pounds."" My mom is my bully, and he is her apologist. I don't how much of this (if anything) constitutes abuse, but my dad doesn't buy any of it and blames it on ""liberal millennial indoctrinated safe-space snowflake bullshit... abuse is broken bones, black eyes and cigarette burns on arms."" He goes on about how he and mom have done everything for me and how there is something in my sick, twisted mind that is confusing ""constructive criticism"" with ""abuse."" Deep down, I am beginning to resent my parents, because they *have* done everything for me, sheltered me and spoiled me to the point where I don't know how the world outside my little bubble works. I am 23 now and don't feel any better off now than I did when I was ten years ago. There are certain life skills I don't have because they did everything for me. I don't feel like I've ever had to work for anything and I hate them for it. They tried to be tougher with me but didn't have the spine. They never forced me to do anything except go to summer camps for special needs kids, they pretty much just let me raise myself and it's costing all of us dearly. Tonight is the night my real life begins. Basically, if I am so afraid of my mom that seeing her on the road freaks me out to the point of an accident, something in our relationship has gone south. I don't know if it's her or me anymore.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: I just told all 100 students I teach I have depression in an email about finals week I'm an undergraduate TA at a university, in an interdisciplinary class about the brain. I absolutely love being a TA, but admittedly this quarter it has been a struggle mentally, I often feel anxious that I am doing a horrible job. I sent out this email to all 100 of my students about finals: Hi everyone, These next two weeks will be a really, really tough time for all of you. I know how incredibly hard you all have worked this quarter, and how hard you will push yourselves during this final stretch, but there are 2 other things I want you to know: 1) I, the other TAs, and our professor will not be disappointed if you do not perform as well you want, so you shouldn't be either. Tests and grades are not always the best reflection of you as students/scientists, and they are most certainly are not a reflection of your worth as a person. All a test assesses is how much content you remember and how well you can take a test at a certain time on a certain day. It is simply one data point, and as you should all know by now, 1 data point is not representative of the population. For many of you, you have other finals/presentations/responsibilities going on, and it'll be difficult to find time to study. For others, you may want so badly to study a lot, but can't because you are so stressed and anxious. I personally deal with anxiety and depression, and I know how utterly frustrating it is when your mind doesn't work as well as you want it to. 2) Take care of yourself. Eat good food, get some sleep, spend time with people you love. So, while you prepare for finals these next weeks, keep these two things in mind. You are all incredibly curious, kind, intelligent and important people. I brag all the time that I get to work with the most amazing group of students who bring unique and valuable contributions to this class everyday, and inspire me to be the best TA I can possibly be. Cheering you on!! ~austen1996 (I can't believe I just told all my students about my mental illness, but it honestly feels so liberating to do so. It also feels so hypocritical of me to send this, because I attribute much of my self-worth to academics and don't practice much self-care.....but I felt like this needed to be said).",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Living At Home With Untrustworthy Family Member This post may be a bit long, but I really need advice , outside of the obvious ""just move out"" , which I will be doing soon, but I need advice for until I do. So I live at home with an untrustworthy uncle who has shown me that I can't trust him. He talks about people behind their back, personally talks down to me, purposely does things to hold me back (such as will place a setback in my way knowing it will affect my moving out --- he asks me to drive someone somewhere using my car during the time I have to be at work, ect.) . Anyway, my uncle wants me to contribute to the household by paying $50.00 towards the electric bill. So I go, ""Ok, no problem."" That is a big problem because I was initially thinking I could go to a bill payment center and just directly pay it there as my debit card company (AMEX, Visa, ect) isn't accepted by the electric company. I called the electric company and was told if I go to a billpayment center that I need the bill or at least the account number. I have neither and am unable to access either because my uncle takes the bill . I have asked to see it, both asking my aunt and uncle. My aunt says ""I am trying to complicate things,"" and informed me that my uncle pays everything via his bank account,which really means to ""contribute"", I am really having to pay my uncle $50 after he pays the whole bill from his bank account. I don't want to do that because I am looking at having to give him that $50 , which is really going in his pocket, versus to the electric company, as a waste of money. I want to be sure my money is going where it is supposed to go (to the electric bill, and not in my uncle's pockets). When my sister lived here, they let her have access to the bills and pay them or parts of them how she wanted. We are two years apart, her being 28, and me being 26. My uncle wastes a lot of money on hookah, and products on Amazon. He believes that my grandmother's house is his house (which is not true at all.) They, being my uncle and aunt are not allowing me to do things the way I want. I want to ensure that my money is going directly to the electric company in particularly because when I have contributed to the household as they (my aunt and uncle) have asked, I have watched my money be used in an unscrupulous manner and have had to deal with them (my aunt and uncle) basically monopolizing my time, so I can never progress with what I need to do in life, such as move out. My aunt tried to ask me how much money I bring in a month, and I refused to tell her. In my family, my family feels like if you are not forthcoming with information then something shady or bad has to be going on. In my case, that is not true. I am a young woman wanting to better herself and continue pursuing her passions (ones that actually will provide for myself and my OWN family --- children, ect if I have any) and leave a legacy behind when my time comes. I am thinking not of just today, but later on down the line. My uncle is very immature. While his mother (my grandmother) was in the hospital due to a heart attack and stroke, he brought a random woman over and had sex with her in his mother's bed, and the girl was very loud and disrespectful considering that I am right down the hall. (Keep in mind, he has his own room on the third floor of the house where no one would be able to hear or see anything he is doing). He also has a superiority complex. My grandmother is still sick, and is supposedly coming home soon. I am trying to save so I can move, and have been the one helping my grandmother while she is sick. I am aware that I am dealing with a toxic family member (well, family members.) My uncle will downtalk me, calling me a bum, saying I don't have certain things, because he doesn't see where any of my money is at or goes (He isn't supposed to, I am a grown adult) , but at the same time, putting every road block in my way to keep me in a position where I can't get on better footing. I honestly feel my family just wants someone that they can talk about and put down. I have told my family that I don't have access to cash, so I can continue to save and move. I did say I can contribute in other ways. I have been the pariah of my family due to what a lot of people have said about me, lies and things that are untrue. I have family members that just want me to fail. I know that for sure. I have thought about waiting for next month's bill to come, and taking the account number off of it to directly pay my portion of the electric bill. To anyone who feels I may be being selfish, complaining , or lazy, I am none of those things. I am currently working and saving money to move to another state. I was taught at an early age to trust my gut, and everything is all messed up right now. I have watched my family and am aware of how they operate. I don't want to be around people I can't trust. Family will betray you faster than your enemies. I am asking regarding this situation, what should I",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Just venting Not sure the general gist of where this post is going but I just kind of want to write down my thoughts. I tend to feel better after I do so. Maybe along with that I can have the added bonus of affecting somebody else in a positive way with what I say or that someone else understands what I'm saying. I'm alone as I type this. I'm sure many people who frequent this sub would describe themselves in that way. I feel over the years I've been getting more and more depressed. I was depressed when in my teens then I hit a lull in my 20s where I just didn't care about much and put things out of mind. Now, I seem to be at a combination of both. A kind of dead, feel nothing type of feeling mixed in with depression. I've been getting angrier as well. Bitter and resentful. I feel like when I was a teen I just thought strongly that I wasn't very great in the general sense. I feel like I now know that to be true. After enough life experience and enough time with yourself you start to see who and what you are. Needless to say I don't like who I am. Maybe you don't either. I'm not as strong, wise, caring, compassionate, friendly, hard-working, courageous, generous, et fuckin cetera that I'd like. ""Well, why don't you change?"" Cause I clearly don't fuckin want to. Maybe I enjoy being depressed? Because obviously I've laid out terms, so to speak, for me to be depressed. Not courageous, hard enough working, kind etc etc. Yet, I don't do shit about it. So why complain as if I'm depressed because of it? I think that's where the day to day numb feeling comes in. It's like ""I am this way. I don't like being this way. I don't change being this way. Why tf are you even upset?"" I really don't feel I deserve what I have in my life. Like the organ donor program I feel I'd want to give my body to someone else. Maybe they can make better use of my fully functional legs. My vision. Ever see those people do an absolute fuck ton of things with their life? Those people who are so driven to accomplish a b c d e f g... Every day of their life and they only have 1 limb? Are blind? Live in abject poverty? I have NONE of these fucking hurdles. I, in fact, don't have anything anyone would legitimately call a hurdle in life and yet I feel depressed. It's probably justified that I feel this way. I don't do anything to try and feel better and I don't capitalize on advantages I have in my life to make things better. To grow as a person. I don't do that for myself let alone for other people. And yet I want to have success.. I want to have profound love. Meaning and purpose. What a joke Just wish I could hit the fast forward button on this shit and get through with it. Oh right.. There's suicide. But even that holds it's own unique stigma to it. Next to no one would recommend you do that. It's not an ideal solution. So on and so forth. But you kind of have to admit that those that do go through with it... It's as if you can't question them. You can't question their pain. Can't question their sense of guilt or anguish or depression and sadness. They solidified it and made it real moreso than practically anyone could ever do when alive. Sometimes I wonder if those that commit suicide do so because it's either a) the only perceived way out of their grief or b) that it effectively proves to others beyond a shadow of a doubt what kind of hell they had been living through in the years leading up to doing it. You can never question someone who killed themselves as to whether their pain was real. Not just in the sense that they're no longer around to ask but that no one would ask what everyone inherently knows. Of course they felt pain. I feel that might be suicides greatest allure. It effectively puts a stamp on your sadness as legitimate. I've thought about it a lot throughout my life. I don't think I'd ever have the stones to do it. Maybe my life or state of mind just isn't that bad. Not yet anyways. Kind of a long read :/ Hi to all those that like reading long posts from internet randoms 👋",reddit_train.csv

Basically from middle school to about a year ago when I finally started on medication. The best way I could describe my depression is voices in my head saying mean and awful things to me, about me, about what other people are thinking or saying about me, turning positives into negatives etc. I started playing a game called Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice tonight and the their is a theme around psychosis, and the main character has many voices in her head.

"Post: I am overwhelmed by guilt over my boyfriend's sexual assault of my once-best friend. My boyfriend of 2 years and I both suffer from mental health issues and trauma. I found out somewhat recently that months ago, when my then-best friend was sleeping over we were both asleep in the bed and he touched her sexually. Apparently he was stoned and thought he might start a threesome (it was casually mentioned as a possibility earlier). I know what he did was horrible. It makes me sick to my stomach to think that I was there and couldn't help. It makes me throw up and stay up at night knowing that I stayed with him. On the other hand, he himself is absolutely sick with guilt. He's been having non-stop anxiety attacks, crying spells, and moments of catatonia and he can't stop saying how horrible it was that he did that and how he wants to be a good person. I believe he is genuine and my first reaction is to make sure he gets treatment so nothing close to that ever happens again. He checked himself into a psychiatric ward last night. I'm also so overwhelmed by guilt by how selfish my internal response has been. He has cheated on me before multiple times, and I can't help but ruminate on how if I were prettier this wouldn't have happened and how it effects me. One recent (smaller) time just happened and I've had to take care of his emotions while being angry about this main terrible incident and that one. Furthermore, I'm selfishly worried about how badly this is affecting me. One of the few (maybe only?) things going right in my life is school and this is affecting me so negatively in my inability to concentrate or motivate myself. I'm also upset by how critical others have been of me in this even though they are at least partially justified. He posted his story to Reddit and got mostly cautious support. I posted mine and got a lot of messages calling me a pervert, an enabler, a shitposter, and a terrible person. He told his parents and one of the things they said was ""all three of you made mistakes"". Unrelated, but last night he posted a photo of us in the ER and a girl who hates me replied ""ew you're back with her? Nonono what are you doing.""

Had no therapy in that time between and also we only had like 6 sessions. Now I have a therapist who is ok but I just don‘t vibe with her that much. And I can‘t change because of insurance. Nor do I have the money to pay for one myself since I‘m a broke ass student. I told her once that I don‘t want solutions. I want someone to genuienly understand me. At first she tried and now it’s all solutions again. „Try this, try that, we need to experiment“. I get the thought but I feel like my deep down feelings are just irrelevant once again. My first therapist really understood me and listened. I could cry my heart out and afterwards I felt so much lighter. I really miss that feeling. Now it‘s just an obligation I have to do. Back then I never used to come late to my therapy sessions because I really looked forward to it. But now I am constantly running late because deep down, I just don‘t want to go anymore and give up. I don‘t have energy for that. I also took anti depressants (Tianeurax if anyone knows that one). At first it helped me, especially with processing feelings. But then I turned super suicidal and had mental breakdowns over mental breakdowns. I completly stopped and now I feel numb again. I want to feel suicidal and emotional again, to be honest. At least I processed something. Now I feel empty and dead inside once again, like how I used to be all the years before I started therapy and taking anti depressants. My „new“ therapist asked me what I can bear more. My suicidal state or this passive suicidal state. I told her the last one. But honestly, I want it to be the first one. At least I felt like a human. At least some people cared because they were afraid I‘d do something to myself. Now no one cares. I‘m alone. I don‘t go outside anymore. I‘m just isolating myself again. No one really talks to me and I‘m just a bother to everyone. I honestly think about taking my anti depressants again, just to get suicidal and off myself. Despite often being a bad actor, I am just so well at playing this role of „Of course, I will try! I will do my best“. I‘m good at pretending nothing bother‘s me and everything‘s fine. I‘m good at pretending to say „Wow, your advice helped me so much, thank you for listening!“. But I‘m just a fraud. Nothing helps. Afterwards I just want to die more. Sometimes I ask myself, why the hell do I even put up with all of this. The only reason why I haven‘t killed myself yet is because it‘d financially ruin my family. I don‘t even care about emotions, I doubt it‘d be that bad. No one likes me anyway. Just so they don‘t get into debt with my death or sth. I often find myself also thinking that I will never leave a goodbye letter or tell them goodbye. Because no one cares anyway. I told them many times before why I want to die. I don‘t feel like anyone deserves that anyway because they don‘t put as much energy into me as I put into them. Whenever I feel like it goes up, it just crumbles down. I really don‘t know how much of this I can take. I‘ve been like this since 6 years old. I‘m 21 now. I don‘t know why I got thrown into this world when I‘m ridden and infested with mental illnesses.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Today I realized I don't have any friends. Not really. This weekend I was going to go to a Harry Potter symphony with my two aunts. One of them and my grandma, who all live together, got sick. They gave me the three tickets. They told me to go with friends, but they don't want to chance getting me sick or no one staying with their mom. Fair enough. As I was driving home from work today I was thinking about who to take, and I came up blank. No one came to mind. I have my roommates, but I don't really talk to them much and they all have girlfriends that they hang out with all the time anyway. Even the ones I went to high school with. I realized the other day when they mentioned it in passing that they had started a new DnD campaign with a new guy. I'm never invited to dinners or anything anymore. We never make a big ass meal together on Saturday anymore. Honestly, I don't think they'd even want to go anyway. There's no one else I'd ask. Everyone at work is either dating someone or I don't know them well enough. I'm taking online classes so no one there either. I don't do anything outside of school or work. I don't even have any friends to take to this fucking symphony. Not even one. I identify more with the characters in the books I read than with anyone I know. I don't know what to do. I feel so alone. I'm not even that close with my family, not really. Not well enough that I can even really talk about my opinions and especially not my emotions. The therapist I saw about a year ago kinda threw me off as SAD and said it'd get better. I just dunno what to do.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Why my relationship is killing me Okay, disclaimer, former relationship... but it still has a huge effect on my life. This girl was my best friend and my first serious relationship. I met her when I first got depressed, and we went to the same church together. I told her then that I didn't feel ready for a relationship, but she essentially stalked me all those (5) years ago. Christmas 2016, after dealing with a crap load more grief and depression, I was essentially forced into a relationship with her. I had just got over my main stint of depression the previous September, and my life was getting better. We still hung out as friends, but she kept pushing for more. However, she is so messed up. I have to say that now. I do still love her, and that will probably never change, but she needs professional help, and my mistake was thinking I could help her. She was my best friend after all. So, after a string of breakups, moving too slow and moving too fast, as well as her cheating on my several times, she finally called it quits one week after my birthday (November just gone). I had no say, because she'd throw a tantrum, but I had to take the initiative. Why? Because she no longer wanted to have my baby. In August, she fell pregnant. This could have been the week prior the Anniversary of our first kiss, but the nurse dated it on that specific date. That was one of the nights she cheated on me, with her friend's boyfriend, but it was ""just a kiss"". She tried to miscarry by drinking heavily for the next few weeks before coming to me about it; she had broken up with me the day after she cheated. I asked her there and then if she wanted to keep it. She said yes. We went to speak to my mum. My mum asked her. She said yes. She wanted to announce the pregnancy, to start all the planning, and looking forward to the future. I got a well paying job to provide for our future, a job I travelled hundreds of miles for each week, and it was only for a few months. But whilst I was away, she decided she missed all the drinking, drugs, and sex she was missing out on. She wanted to live with her friends (who she actually hates living with at times), and countless other reasons. However, she kept stringing me along until the scan, where she sent me a photo of our child before telling me she wanted to abort it. Oh, and I had planned a weekend away for us to relax and see some friends. She had me believe this was the start of my happy ever after, before ripping it away from me. She didn't speak to me for two weeks. When I finally did manage to get in touch, it was to collect my stuff. I took a mutual friend with me, the act as a buffer, and they couldn't believe the stuff that she said to me. Then I get a load of hate off her because people are contacting her about her choices. Remember, she has been posting on FB all about the baby, making sure everyone knows. She hasn't spoken to me since. She has blocked me anyway she can, even on WhatsApp only recently... not that it matters, because she wants nothing to do with me. This was my best friend, and my stalker, who for years wanted to be with me, have a family with me, worried I wouldn't want her because of PCOS, and got jealous over people talking to me on Twitter, and kittens! She couldn't even handle me showing up with chocolates and flowers! All that I've done for her, supported her, sacrificed for her... and this is how she treats me. Now, I am pro-life, and pro-choice. I gave her that choice, and she wanted to go ahead. I didn't force her or convince her. She led me. She set me up, just to rip out my heart. Seriously, if you only knew the half of it. The card she wrote for me for my birthday alone would have anyone convinced. But now, she is living her life. She is out drinking, smoking, doing drugs and sleeping with anything she can get her claws into. She has restarted her YouTube ""career"", and quite frankly, they're boring videos. Maybe she'll do better. I hope not. But I think that's normal. So why this post? Because it is killing me. I don't know how, but I'm still kicking. Depression is creeping at my door, and I do have horrible days, bad days where I am so demotivated. Yet, I cannot stop thinking about her. She has me broken, in ruins... even my faith has been hit hard. I don't understand what changed. I don't understand she did what she did. Why did she play me for so long just to hurt me? Everyone tells me to forget about her, and no one would allow me to go back to her (even if it was a possibility). All I want to do is to forget about her, because as the title says... this relationship is killing me.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Depressed people get sick, too; How stigma in the medical community made me sicker I’ve often found myself in a chicken and egg situation with my doctors when it comes to depression. When I say I’m sick, they are too quick to assume the depression is the cause of my pain and not the other way around. After five minutes listening to me breathe, looking into my throat, and and touching the outside of my neck, they are stumped so it must be mental illness. It got the the point that when I was having severe abdominal pain, I didn’t go to the hospital. I had to push for any kind of testing, which took forever. When I finally found a doctor who listened to me, she told me I should have gone to the ER. Then I was depressed about that; I had let the other doctors make me doubt my own sanity. Turns out, I’ve been pretty sick and needed surgery. Nearly all of the issues they blamed on depression were due to a chronic, painful illness with no cure. It’s bittersweet, I’ve solved a big piece of the puzzle for sure. But I’m still struggling a lot. I just found out that I may be infertile. After my doctor said having a baby could help my condition. So that was depressing too. (I don’t think my depression caused my infertility. Checkmate, doctors!) I did start seeing a psychiatrist, and he is a kind man. He diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. He has never suggested that my depression is the cause of my physical problems, and he seems to be sympathetic to me as a chronic pain patient. He’s given me depression medication, but I don’t know how much it’s helping. Chronic illness is a thing that happens to people and it’s just *depressing*. I’ve always had depression, but this just makes it worse. He has never dismissed me for feeling that way or written off my pain as being in my head. Just wanted to share my experience with others who might understand. People with depression can experience health issues and get dismissed so easily. It took me years and years to get anywhere. It’s a struggle to cope with both mental and physical illness. Here’s to getting through today, friends.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: I'm 19 and tired of living I'm writing because I don't have anyone else to talk to in real life that could understand me. I'm a 19 years old girl, close to turning 20, never had a relationship in my life and only kissed a boy once. I've had boys hit one me before but I always turned them down. I feel terrible that I've never dated anyone, but in reality I don't even know what my sexuality is and I don't think that I'd be a good partner to anyone. I feel so miserable and sad all the time. I hate my body and my appearance even though I know that I'm not really ugly. I don't know why my self esteem is so low. I don't have energy anymore do anything in my life. I don't have a lot of friends and the ones that I've had in high school I don't talk much to them. I always end up isolating myself from people and the regretting it later. I don't know why I do this. I don't why I hate myself so much. I just wished that I could love myself. I think I'm depressed but I don't know for sure. I went to a psychologist a while ago and all I could do was cry and tell them how miserable I felt and they basically didn't tell me anything and it felt like a waste of money. Anyway, I don't know what I have, I just know that there's something wrong with me. I feel like I've wasted my teenage years away being socially anxious and not connecting with people, and I don't why I am like this. I just wished that I could socialize and be happy and not care so much about how I look and how others perceive me. The year is coming is to an end and I am just feeling terrible because I'm still lonely and depressed and because I'm not in college yet because I didn't study enough for the entrance exam.

"Post: Help with/what to do about toxic sister? (Sorry for sloppy wall and if this isn't the right thread) As the title says I don't know what to do about my 29 year old sister. She is known by the family to be immature, selfish, and impulsive. She repeatedly burns bridges with family when she does not get her way and will give them the short end of a deal if it benefits her (ie. Not paying my financially struggling mother back on the multiple occasions of covering her rent or car payment because she decided to use her paycheck on a new TV or $200 purse). I'd love to not speak to her and never go to her place but because she is the mother of my 2 year old niece this is not possible. To give you some perspective, she has fights with my niece's father who got their old apartment raided by the police for selling heroin (finding heroin and a pistol in a safe in the apartment) to the point of yelling and hitting, even late at night when the child should be asleep, right in front of my niece. Because her father is soon going on trial and to prison for a long time (ex convict in possession of a firearm on top of selling heroin) and as previously stated, my sister being a half-assed parent, I am left to clean up after her when it comes to my niece. I have to be consistent in teaching her not to hit people and not to spit at them. Again, to give you some perspective, I am 15 years old and do not need the stress of making sure a child grows up to be a decent person on my plate. My sister has multiple DUI and assault charges which have resulted in her drivers license being revoked yet she continues to drive with my niece in the car even when everyone who knows her and cares about the child tells her not to. Although she is better now she is still a complete ass of a parent with her first kid dying before the age of one and losing custody of her two other sons about 9 years ago (older one being 13 and the other being 9). I am actually convinced her uterus is hexed because every time she has a kid shit goes horribly south which makes me terrified in the case of my niece. In the winter of 2016 my sister attempted suicide (my niece being just under 1) and while her drug dealer boyfriend screamed at her while she laid on the floor saying she wanted to die I had to make sure the child was still sleeping through all of it in the next room. Now although few and far apart, I've had my struggles with depression so I understand how difficult postpartum depression can be but even then I believe as a parent you always put the child first in every scenario. On top of everything else she completely spoils my niece buying her an unnecessary amount of toys and candy whenever she reaches for it at the store and I know she is not going to be able to handle it when my niece wants something at the mall my sister absolutely cannot afford at the moment and her entire worldview changes when she realizes she does not get everything she wants when she wants it. Although I mostly enjoy being alone and I have never been in a relationship I can only imagine possible significant others would not be totally understanding when I try to explain that my niece comes first which only adds to the stress and worry. To be clear, my sister is not neglectful and provides for my niece with everything a child needs such as diapers, food, bed, cleaning, etc. but if she continues this way (which I know she will) my niece will grow up with the same characteristics as my sister and it's just about all up to me to make sure that doesn't happen. Can someone please, PLEASE help me?",reddit_train.csv
"Post: The divorce talk The wife and I have had a very empty and distant relationship over the last few years. After a couple of very difficult circumstances in our lives we sought counseling several times which didn't help at all so we resigned ourselves to being basically roommates for the sake of our children. Neither of us cheated BTW or at least I didn't. We decided to talk last evening and alot came out. We're ready to call it quits. I knew the relationship was dead but thought we would eventually come around. I love her and am committed to her. She ""loves me but is not in love with me"" anymore. I'm scared of what this will do to our kids the oldest is very sensitive. We decided to try a thing. We're going give ourselves X months and set aside time every evening to really talk about the things that bother us, the things that brought us to this situation, what we fear for it kids, what we want for our lives, all of it while doing it best to accept/not judge the other person. We have not really spoken to each other like this since before the kids so this may help. If this doesn't change the relationship we'll decide whether we'll separate or divorce. I have not told her this but I will be considering the option of suicide since I feel it would be easier for the children to cope with my death than to give them any reason to believe it was in any way their fault.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Getting motivated to get help I was diagnosed with a mood disorder and PTSD ~1.5 years ago. I was getting help for a while but I dropped out of school and moved out of state so I just haven't been able to do that in the past year. I live with (and mooch off of) an SO but I've been fairly isolated for about 6 months. I've been doing online school but had to drop my classes this semester when I started working. Now all I do is this stupid part-time job. I should probably quit because it makes me incredibly suicidal. It's all so superficial. It doesn't feel beneath me but I really just don't mesh with it. Anyway. Health insurance. I can't figure out how to fill out the income stuff. A hospital near me has people that can help but I just can't find the motivation to even call them. It's like I'm trying to prevent myself from getting help. It's not even just psychiatric reasons that I want health insurance. I have a referral for a neurologist. I've been having memory issues, twitches, etc. I know I won't go without insurance. I probably could stand to get on birth control and check out some other persistent problems too but a) I know I won't be taken seriously and b) the only thing I genuinely like about myself is my mind so that's the priority. I'm not completely not trying. I'll take St. John's Wort if I'm persistently suicidal but it doesn't help with motivation. I've been going to support groups. I'll ""decide"" to be motivated but end up collapsed and sobbing before I get out of the door. Play music, leave my phone behind so I don't get sidetracked. Tell people what I'm doing so I feel pressured to keep my word. Incentivize with promises of fast food, caffeine, or chocolate. I dunno what else to do. I can't even tell if it's laziness or depression or something else. The only thing that motivates me to go to work is fear which is also the main thing that prevents me from quitting.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: How To Get Over The Pain I ended/lost a friendship with a best friend of 14 years. She was really good to me, once upon a time; I was declared disabled and lost my house and she let me move in with her and her husband to get back on my feet. For all she knew I could've been the Thing That Never Leaves. But I lived with her for about 9 months, got a job, and got my own place. She's Mormon, and during this time had her first kid. She insists everything's fine, no worries (because she had to, I think; Mormons put a lot of pressure on their women.) But things start getting distant between us, and this is only something I notice in hindsight. I got the greenlight to publish a book, and she offered to typeset because she had InDesign. Okay, are you sure? Yes. You're sure? Yes. Okay, cool, thanks, that's awesome, I don't have to do it myself cause I don't have the program or know how to use it. I give her a deadline for October and pay her. Well, I bust my ass on this book for months. It's the most important thing I've ever done with my life and it means everything to me. And 4 days before deadline, I find out she's only done up to Chapter 5 on the book. Which basically means she fucked off for 4 months, and did nothing, which means she's going to do a rush job. That automatically means more mistakes that I have to depend on her to fix, which she didn't in the first place, and she's totally shattered my trust. I freaked the fuck out on her and had a hysterical meltdown. It was bad, and I don't make any excuses for it. I was really shitty to her. I panicked and thought she was going to hold the book hostage with procrastination, and I had no way to get the files from her. I'd put myself up shit creek, because it was too late for me to learn InDesign. Well, she was defensive, to say the least. She said I don't need to police her time, and I should've known this is how she works. I felt like she was trying to gaslight me, so I posted on Facebook about the situation without naming names and asked other professional artist friends if this was appropriately professional behavior. They said no. That REALLY pissed her off, because a few days later I got a letter. In it she said she'd done all this stuff for me (let you live in my house, put up with your shit etc.), said I didn't want her to have her dream family and dream life (she was doing horse archery competitions and I didn't want her to do that, either, apaprently), my shitty upbringing made me dysfunctional, and she gave me an ultimatum that I had to make a change. Until then she said she didn't want me to talk to her, and she was ""closing her door to me."" I felt supremely judged, i.e. ""My perfect Mormon family was NEVER dysfunctional, so obviously you're the problem here, as a dysfunctional person yourself. Not me."" I felt like I'd been un-forgiven, ""Hey, remember all that stuff I said I forgave you for? Surprise!"" And I felt horrible, like I could never apologize enough, and that from here on out I was going to be scapegoated because I was the fucked up one and she was the squeaky-clean Mormon. I left her alone for about 6 week, not talking to her like she said. Then I reached out, apologized, and asked if we could talk in person without anymore nastygram letters. And this, to be honest, is where I'm most mad at myself, because I wish I'd just cut things off the minute she started talking like her shit didn't stink. Instead, we met, and she said my apology made her angry because it sounded like I'd disregarded her letter. I was a bit taken aback, because the letter sounded like one of those venting things where you're supposed to write them but not send them, and instead she was acting like she'd sent me gospel I needed to abide by. I said I felt like I was always going to be the wrong one, no matter what. She said I came from a dysfunctional family, compared me to a fear-agressive dog, and said ""Which problem is more in need of fixing?"" So in other words, yeah. Yeah, I was always going to be wrong, because no matter what she did I was always going to be worse because of my background. She said I'd declared her typesetting ""a failure"" before I even saw it, and insisted she'd done a good job. I told her there were obvious mistakes, like misaligned tabs and words running into illustrations, and she said she'd made the deadline and reiterated that once again, I should have known she procrastinates. I told for someone who had gone to church for twenty plus fucking years, she didn't know how forgiveness works because Jesus doesn't say ""Forgive thine enemies, until you've got a whole pile of ammunition and can really use that shit against them."" (I'm agnostic.) She said she'd already apologized (implication being that I couldn't forgive) and when I told her it felt like she could never make a mistake, she screamed ""YOU JUST WANT ME TO GROVEL!"" and stormed off. Her husband came out, yelled at me, and told me to ""handle my shit"" and called me a toddler. Previously he'd admitted to me in private that he wouldn't hire his own wife for a job because of her lack of professionalism. The next day I wrote her saying I needed my book files, to make sure the publisher could make corrections. And once that was good to go, I told her I was",reddit_train.csv

"Post: How can I get my finances back to a point where I can go to school or to a point where I don’t hate my life? I guess some backstory. I’m 19 about to be 20 in September. When I was in spring of 11th grade my mom got sick (Lupus or something, honestly she might be faking it but that’s a whole different post.) Anyway she went to the hospital and was there for about a month. I ended up skipping a lot of school to be able to care for and do all the general house duties for my younger brothers. (11yrs old and 1yr old at the time.). Things progress my mom misses a lot of work we end up moving with my grandma. Now here’s where shit really hits the fan. So tensions build between my grandma and my mom because of my moms suspected prescription opiate and Benzo abuse. Anyhow, dfchs gets involved (not related to the drugs but that didn’t help) about 4 months before I go to college and my moms health deteriorates seemingly out of nowhere. So freshman and sophomore year I’m juggling trying to work to support myself, school, and helping my grandma take care of my brothers. I thought I could handle it, I couldn’t. Of course my schoolwork suffered and my gpa dropped below Hope eligibility. So I tried to find a full time job, and I did. Then got laid off not too soon after due to “budget cuts.” My first time experiencing adulthood. Shortly after my car died and my depression got to a dark place. What followed is 3months of applying to anything I could reasonably walk to (I was trying to search within 5miles) because transportation in the part of Georgia I was in was a huge deal and I could not get around. No jobs responded. Including the Walmart a mile away with a fucking hiring sign out front that I repeatedly went in to try and talk and build rapport with the managers. During these 3 months I took out 3 credit cards and ended up maxing them out. I needed food and other essentials that I simply had no money for. The depression kinda spiraled out of control. I had a plan in place to hang myself but my friends at the time took the rope I was going to use and I was too broke to buy another. My dad who has been in and out of my life. Mostly out prior to this. Invited me out to come stay with him and his family in LA while I tried to get myself together. I’m working hard, I found a job here. Retail but it’s a job. I’m waking up early, I’m doing noFap and I’m working out 3x a week to try to keep my depression in check. But despite all that, I want to kill die still. I don’t see a future where I’m able to continue school. Dfchs told me they couldn’t help pay for college because “I wasn’t in for long enough before beginning college” but they had no fucking problem coming to my dorm and asking me questions and causing stress once a week. I feel like I’m barely supporting myself, and honestly I haven’t talked to my brothers since the youngest ones birthday (April 15th). Because I feel like I failed them. I haven’t talked to my grandma either because I feel like a disappointment. And my mom keeps calling me every other month telling me she’s gonna kill herself because she feels like nobody loves her. Even through I bent over fucking backwards trying to help her by bringing my brothers to see her and making sure they could talk. (My grandma and the rest of my moms family won’t talk to her because she’s cursed all of them out horribly when they tried to be there for her)",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Does anyone else's depression show itself as exhaustion? I find as I get older, that certain heavy type of exhaustion that can only be caused by depression gets more and more pervasive. As soon as things start going downhill, the unexplained tiredness hits and I become like a zombie. I have no energy to do my normal daily tasks, the thought of going through my evening routine before bed seems like climbing a fucking mountain; I barely have the energy to do anything other than sit on the couch and stare into space. The physical lethargy always comes hand-in-hand with the Brain Fog. Forget trying to study, forget going through the bills, my brain can't handle anything except moving my index finger to scroll down Reddit and watching cheap entertainment on youtube or Netflix. I'm writing this because I'm in it now - in the Fog - and I'm lagging behind in life. Does anyone else feel this way? Does anyone know how to get out?",reddit_train.csv

"Post: what is going on with my mom? As I've gotten older I identified something which was probably a source of a lot of neuroticism growing up, but I'm not really sure I'm in the right for noticing this. I have no idea what this is, I haven't met many other people that do this. But my Mom will do this thing where, the happier I get, the less comfortable she is around me. She tries almost frantically or rabidly to cut me off mid sentence or like ""steal my affectation."" Like mirroring that is a bit too eerily similar. Its almost like a ""being a person contest."" I always feel like, gross afterward. Like someone got in my head and took a part of me then did a parody of it. It seems like nothing is going in, and only like warped versions of what I just said are coming out. Like her identity is being threatened or something. And it's only when I'm happy. She seems completely comfortable when I am depressed, and its still all out, no in. It's like she's doing a one man play. I mean I could be overthinking this, I just don't know. Is anyone skilled with like psychoanalysis or something? It seems surreal. I've rarely seen people do this. Am I doing something wrong? Like, am I not being a person right or something? She seems so unnerved by signs of happiness. It almost makes me feel fake or something. It legit feels like I'm beating her at tennis or something. Like the more emotion I am feeling naturally, she tries to one up me. And hers does not feel natural. It makes me uneasy. Is there a reason a person would do this? I really am eager to know what this is or how I can avoid it or make ends with it.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Aha! moment during therapy So I've been meeting with a therapist about once a week since October of 2017. It's been really great, and has helped pull me from the brink more than once. Background: I'm gay, and was raised Catholic in the 90s. Guess what happened next! Spoiler: I was bullied mercilessly. If I wasn't too gay, I was too fat, or too tall, or too weird or too unpopular. You get the gist. It it wasn't my hair, it was my mannerisms; if it wasn't my high voice, it was the dark circles under my eyes. (Gee, what could have caused me to be losing sleep?) Flash forward to today: My therapist guided me through a meditation today that instructed me to visualize and speak to a younger version of myself. I described what I looked like, what characteristics defined me, and how I saw myself. Then I was instructed to, as myself as the adult I've become, speak to that child and tell him what I was feeling. I spoke with kindness and compassion and love and respect for that child, and told him everything would be alright. I told him that all of that hatred was wrong, that it was incorrect and that those people who say all those nasty hurtful things, they probably aren't even going to remember saying it, so don't waste your time holding onto it. And it got me thinking about all of the baggage I've he'd onto my life. All the glances and side comments and nasty, hateful things. And how I've internalized it, and believed it. And that's when the Aha! moment came. *All this time, I've been so worried about all the bullying that other people did, I wasn't even thinking about all the bullying I did to myself.* https://media.giphy.com/media/12KiGLydHEdak8/giphy.gif All this time, *it was me.* Sure, it was other people who planted those seeds, but it was me who perpetuated it, who told myself that they were true. After all, if you say something enough, it might as well be as true as anything else. So there it is. There's one step. It might just be one step, but it's a step in the right direction. There's my holy shit moment of the day, and I just wanted to share with you all. There is hope. There is progress. There is love. And I hope you all are able to find it.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Unsure how to talk to friend about something they're doing, or well, not doing. [Advice] First time poster in need of a bit of advice. Sorry this'll be long. So basically, I've been having a bit of an issue with a friend of mine, we've been friends for around 3 years at this point and everything was great! We'd talk every day and hang out around once a week/2 weeks depending on schedules and [my] kids schedules etc. Then about 8(ish) months ago, she got a new boyfriend, and of course I'm really happy for her, she deserves all the happiness! Thing is though, over the last 5 months, there's been a steep decline in conversation between myself, said friend and another friend. Friend #2 and I have been making ALL the effort to make plans with friend #1 and we're getting almost nothing back. We'll text her and we'll not hear anything for days, but she's on Facebook or snapchat posting pictures of her and her new boyfriend, and when she does text back, it's a totally one sided conversation. Like I'll ask her maybe ""how have you been"" and I;ll get a page of text about how she has been with BF and what they've been doing and at the end it'll be ""okay, I got to go, bye!"" If I don't specifically ask her about her baby (who I adore, she's like my niece) I don't hear about her, at all. It's all about BF. Recently, Friend #1 and I didn't see each other for just over 3 months! (did I mention she lives 20 minutes away from me?) No matter how many times I asked her over, offered to go to her house, offered to take her to coffee etc, either the invite went unacknowledged, or she wanted to spend the time with her BF. At that point, I was a bit annoyed but, I understood that people have lives and sometimes things just don't match up. However, the reason I'm looking for advice is because, after not seeing her for 3 months and talking to her only a handful of times, she hits me up and asks if I can watch her baby so she can go out with another friend. (who wasn't even going, she took her BF) I said yes, as I know how it is to want to go out and not to have a babysitter, so my husband and I watched baby over night for her. The ONLY thing I said to her was that I had plans the next day after 1 so I needed her to be back before then. (spoiler: she wasn't!) So I couldn't do my plans and asked friend #1 to stay and hangout since I hadn't seen her for so long. In the 1 hour(!) that she stayed, she called my sister (who I had plans with - we were meant to take my youngest out for his birthday, because friend hadn't come back yet, my sister took him out by herself) a freak! She said 3 times ""imagine not waiting for you!"" I said to her, we'll it's because you weren't back and she blamed traffic for being 2 hours late... On top of the main incident, there's been an incident where she brought a stranger to my house (after I told her I didn't like strangers in my house or around my children) and expected me to be okay with it! She dropped the bomb of bringing this stranger to my house 15 minutes before they arrived and told them I didn't want them there so they felt awkward! (I did try really hard to make them feel welcome, and thankfully the kids had plans so they weren't put in the situation) The advice I'm seeking is - A. How do I talk to friend #1 about this without coming off as bitchy or upsetting her. and B. Should I keep being friends with her? I don't like to give up on a friendship, but I feel like she only wanted me around when she wanted something from me. Any advice is welcome, even if it's me being weird or whatever. Thanks guys.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Where did I go wrong? Let me apologize by the rather lengthy post: I’m not sure where to start. Recently, I’ve been having trouble with my friends and I’m not sure why. I had a childhood friend since Elementary school, we would hang out often and now she’s a stranger. She would say she was busy, but the last day I texted her, my dad had kidney surgery because he had cancer in his kidney. They removed the whole kidney and the day he got home, I texted my childhood friend that he was home and he was doing okay. She couldn’t even take one second to respond “I’m glad your dad is okay?” That was it for me, I had to remove her on Facebook after she had to replied after a week, two weeks, etc. and I believe I deleted all messages on my cell phone, and I’m not sure what happened ! Then this “friend” of mine, never messages me on either Instagram or Facebook. I think it began when I told her I asked out one of her friends a year ago (we are still friends, the girl I asked out), and from then she started not to respond to me. So, recently I told my friend who I asked out, about the communication between me and her friend. She told me that her friend, (who is also her roommate) that they’re both extremely busy, which I understand, but and that “she” loves me, and doesn’t hate me (my friend who doesn’t respond, and not love in a boyfriend way.) But, if this is the case why doesn’t she communicate with me online? Even when I see her, she waved hi to me and we talk a bit, but it’s not the same. There were times in the past where she use to hug me a lot, any time she saw me. But something has changed with her and me, I can tell. I think my friend (the girl I asked out), is unaware of my “friend’s” (her roommates) , true feelings toward me, and I mean that in a bad way. I’m just not sure where I went wrong....",reddit_train.csv

I’m shitty at talking to people and making friends. Im losing all my friends because my depression makes me distance myself away from people in hopes of them noticing my absence but no one notices.

Usually i have something in my head, that keeps thoughts inside, but now its nothing here except my inner voice. If i imagine this, it looks like a big endless gray room with voiceless me and my clone somewhere in that room. Sometimes i think i can cry, but i can't even squeeze out a tear. I can show emotions, but feel nothing inside. I can smile if someone makes joke, but it's made up smile. I don't think friends know more than i told them, but i know there is something they hide from me. I go to school, but it ""feels"" like everything just passes around me, like i don't exist. I don't want anything, just go to sleep and never wake up, but it won't happen to me... I can't control anything. When i eat, food doesnt have any difference, it just fills void called hunger. I can't remember anything happened to me last 4 days. Is it bad memory or nothing really happened to me? Days ago i had thoughts, good thoughts, bad thoughts, suicidal thoughts, but they are gone now. Same with feelings. All i have now is emptiness. It hurts so much.",reddit_train.csv

I've been to a doctor before and got medication but I didn't want that to be the first solution. I guess I expected my doc to have the answer for me to get better. I didn't take the meds because the crazy side effects and again I only wanted to take them if I absolutely need them and the doc didn't even try anything else.

"Post: I didn't expect there are people here so quick to judge and assume I made a post about how hard it is to date and find someone if you have depression. I mentioned how people with depression who have a significant other most likely have an easier time that those who don't. What I didn't imply was that I wanted that just for the sake of ""curing"" my depression. And that's what another member tried to pin on me. He or she quickly went into offensive and started preaching about how selfish it is to want to be in a relationship if you're depressed, how I should go seek therapy and that I should realize that relationships aren't a magic cure. I don't want to be in a relationship for it to fix my depression, I'm going to therapy, taking antidepressants for 6 years now and I am fully aware being with someone isn't a cure ( I was with someone while depressed for 2 years ). I wanted to reply to this person to explain they misunderstood me, but I was too upset, so I deleted the post.

"Post: It's hard to keep standing up, keep fighting, and get down each time. I just want it to end I’m done. Hard work doesn’t pay off. Ever since I was 14 I felt depressed and like I’m not good enough. I felt like it was my own fault that I felt so sad and angry and that I wasn’t good enough for other people. One day I decided that if it we’re my own fault I felt that way then I could also improve my situation. Al my negative emotions went into working hard. I finished my studies (not by working hard, but because I was good at it) and put all negative emotions into working out. I got accepted into a difficult job at the Army. Now I quit the Army because of an injury in my knees. At the same time I lost a girl, even though we only went on one date, I thought she could be the one positive thing to take from the Army and all the hard work I put in to get into the Army. So what’s my situation now? Jobless, girls still despise me, have a degree with which I can’t find a job with and all the work I put into improving my situation was for nothing. While trying to improvie myself and during my studies and time at the Army I still had periods where I felt very down. It just becomes harder and harder and harder to crawl out of it every time. The negative voices and feelings are too much and getting up to fight just becomes impossible. I had the power once to get up and try to fight. Now I don’t even have the power to suicide. But I just wish it was all over. Eventhough it feels useless I might go to a psychologist. How has it helped you guys? I wan’t to end it all but I don’t want to end it all. I don’t know.

In love, I'm full of goals, ideas, glass half full, my bank account may be low, but it doesn't effect me. I can deal with anything while in love. I'm more confident while in love.

I'm still in love with her, but we can no longer be together. I'm scared of the world now. Constantly battling anxious thoughts and worries.

"Post: Crashing In Sorry this is long. I've been depressed since I was 15. First signs were at age 4. I found pot and stayed high for 8 years. Clean and sober for 30 years, I never stopped having suicidal thoughts despite medication. So I tried to bury the pain in relationships, which didn't work either. I've been married three times in recovery. I had a daughter who I love very much, and we used to be very close. She became a reason to live. Then 4 years ago she didn't want to live with me 1/2 time any more. She became argumentative and we fought a lot. Last year I found out she was accusing me of sexual abuse, with help from her mom ( first wife) and therapist, which is not true. The therapist never reported the abuse, and told daughter I have NPD, which also is not true. So I got a guardian ad litem to investigate and found my daughter was suicidal, claiming PTSD because of the alleged molestation. The lawyer never helped my daughter, sparking a slide into deeper depression. My wife and parents didn't do much to try to help. They got angry when I begged them to step in. Suidical ideation and inappropriate attention-getting threats became an actual plan, and a way to do it without leaving the stain of suicide. Then at work I made a $5 billion discovery that is extremely disruptive in the industry I work in. My quarter million dollar program found out millions are being spent on the wrong strategy. And 1/2 my team works on the other strategy at the same time as they are helping me, so they are taking steps to undermine the findings. Lately they gave up trying to block the discovery, and the fact that we can literally feed more people with no more land used for farming, by raising more animals (naturally) with the same amount of feed. I'm getting invited to speak globally about the discovery. The suicidal thoughts deepen, knowing the disruption to status quo is only beginning. Just before Christmas my third wife moved out, and I spent Christmas alone because my parents were sick. Last night she told my mom she intends to get a divorce. The medicine isn't working. The AA old timers are saying I'm depressed because I'm not working the steps correctly. I'm going to 2-3 meetings a day, most days. In two days I'm shutting down the case I opened to try to get help for my daughter. I can hardly work, because I can't complete thoughts very well any more, being so depressed. I've been complaining about feeling depressed and suicidal, because it's true, and it became a way to relate to the world, which makes people leave. The spiral is getting tighter, and it feels like a black hole is pulling me in. I can't imagine facing another divorce feeling this low. Mom said to get a roast beef out of the freezer and cook it with some potatoes and carrots and stop thinking about negative things. I went to Landmark and they say this is all just a story, and part of a racket I created to avoid responsibility. They say I can create something different by changing my story. I've tried a rainbow of medicine, and tomorrow I increase Latuda from 20 mg to 40, and keep the trintellex at 20, per MD. I can't do anything now because third wife will get 1/2, and parents are too old to deal with my belongings. My thoughts turn to seeing if I can find someone else who will love me anyway, or giving up. I want to give up but not really. I really want to live, but I can't see any hope. And I can't stand the thought of being alone. Any help, hope or ideas would be appreciated. Thank you.",reddit_train.csv

After recently getting out of the hospital for a(nother) attempt at my life, I was surrounded by family and friends who want to support me. For a couple days this almost gave me a high, thinking that maybe I really am glad I wasn't able to go through with it or that maybe I was beating these years of depressiveness. Not even just after a week of getting out of the mental ward, I fantasize about what I could have done differently to have made sure I died that night. Going forward I thought I would be happy being able to see my younger siblings and my dog again, yet the only thing I can think of is them knowing I tried killing myself, and that I have added just another thing to deal with and another burden on them. I will now be treated with *care* and people will be on guard around me, and I didn't want to do that to them. This semester has started again and I have already missed the first week, and while part of me just wants to drop everything, I can't afford to start paying back the loans. I just want to curl into a ball and not exist and have to deal with it all. TL:DR - trying to take the easy way out has just made everything harder.",reddit_train.csv

At 2017's March my mother's only brother (sibling in general) past away from heart disease and next month my father found this as distraction may i say to begin saying that my mother is a wh@re and is going to the school so the head-chef f@cks her.... its so sad guys that this guy left the work at school 3 months before that , he went to almost everyone he knew to characterize and judge my mother as a wh@re. Literally to everybody... well my mother shutted her mouth and stood back not resisting (i dont know how to describe it well) and actually let him come back to our house at approx. August , hm it went well shall i say for sometime but all of a sudden he left the house and went back to his paranoia .. he found a gypsy woman which he has relationship with now ( she is fat and ugly) , i managed to crack his facebook account and we ( me and my mom) got into his conversations with that ""lady"" and we found really smuttile stuff , there was things about v@brators and m@sturbating and really sad stuff in there .. my mother now has depression and she is so stressed (she considered suiciding actually) ... now that gypsy is controlling him and shes taking his money and she's trying to seduce him away from us , she's ridiculing him in public (cafes and other places).

"Post: My friend refuses to pay his 600 dollar lost wager to me. What to do? [Long text] One day, a friend and I started arguing about something. It turned into a heated but friendly discussion, and eventually we were both fed up with each other's differing views, so we both proposed a wager. We then spent the rest of the day simply arguing, but without any real conclusion, we decided to actually follow through with our wager. Before making the wager, we agreed on 600 dollars, and it was 100% agreed on from both sides. Fast forward to him losing the wager and promising to pay me within a month or so when he would get his next salary. I also felt a bit bad about winning, so I decided to call him and ask him what he would have done in the exact same situation if the roles were reversed. He said he would have taken the money. Right then and there, I decided I would also then take the money, as my friend is (or so I thought) a man of honor. During no time did I ever say I didn't want the money from him. Some time after I won, I made a little joke on facebook along the lines of: ""When am I getting my juicy money?"" with a little meme, as it would be awkward to simply tell him to pay me. He simply said: ""I invested the money into [[fucking]] ethereum [[of all things he could have done]], and it rose 16%! I probably won't pay you the money."" I thought this was a joke, but later found out he was 100% serious. Of course this made me mad - not only that he wouldn't pay me all of a sudden, but also that he broke the news in such an arrogant way. I then argued with him, saying he owed me the money and we agreed on it as two men who made a very serious wager, both knowing what we would get ourselves into. I know for a fact that I would have paid him the second I would have lost, and I have told him so many times. He now claims that it is too much to pay, that it doesn't feel right (yet he also feels guilt) and that I am being negative and should just move on. I get very mad at unjustice just like this, as could very well have lost the wager. I basically took a very unnecessary risk with this wager. I've told him I can't trust him anymore, but he seems to just want to move on, typing messages on Facebook like nothing has changed. He said he was sorry, but I don't accept the apology as he can still do what is right: pay me the money. He tried twisting this on me trying to make me look greedy, when in fact he is the one who fucking scammed his friend. What is your view on this?",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Being told by my brother making friends isn’t that hard for someone my age bothers me every time I think about it It’s pretty damn hard when I have no hobbies to relate to anyone except stay in my room on my computer because I’d rather just be away from everyone so I don’t make it hard on them. And being told to go to clubs by my parents. I just feel more of a disappointment when I tell them there’s nothing I’m interested in and that I also am too afraid to still be alone when I join one. I’ve done everything I could in my life to try to fit in or make new friends, and there’s a reason why I have no motivation to try any of these anymore. And then they say it wouldn’t hurt trying. That couldn’t be any further from the truth. If I try to fit in again and still don’t have anyone to talk to, I’m gonna hate my life even more. It’s like I’m trapped. I can’t do anything to please me. One day I want friends, then the next I don’t want anybody at my school to bother me because I know they don’t really want me to be there friend. Why does depression always put you in a trap that you can’t get out of? There’s no solution except accept your problem and just be an introvert and ignore everyone.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I am too much of a coward to even kill myself I am posting this here, not primarily to garner attention or sympathy, but because I have nowhere else to turn and I don't know what to do with myself. I also want to try and combat some of the embarrassment and shame that I feel in regards to being clinically address, so perhaps voicing what I am thinking here, it could potentially be therapeutic for me. Now that is out of the way,this might get quite long, so I will put a tldr at the end of this. Context: I am a 20 year old girl. My whole life, my sense of worth was dictated around whether I could make the people around me happy. I had extremely strict and controlling parents and so I had no real sense of worth other than the fact that at least I didn't harbour any malicious feelings towards anyone, or try and hurt anybody deliberately. I had normal teenage 'angst' and moody, brooding periods, but absolutely not depression at all. I was completely, for want of a better word, normal. In April 2017, I first had feelings of depression, when I realised how badly I had hurt someone who used to be very important in my life. (it is an extremely long story and I am slightly more at peace with it now so I don't feel the need to explain because it would take forever). I was incapicitated for a week, I would cry constantly, not leave my bed, and my mum would scream at me and tell me she 'didn't have time to deal with my shit'. However I had a REASON for feeling this down, so whether this was the start of a biological depression, I am not quite sure. Fast forward to October 2017. This is where my current situation and problems begin. I am currently studying abroad in Japan- something I have been envisioning and looking forward to for 10 years. Honestly, I had been constantly dreaming about this for an extremely long time. It was what I felt my life was gearing towards, everything led to this. However, it all went downhill. My host family is incredibly lovely, I had made a couple friends on social media before even joining the university, and there were so many intercultural exchange opportunities to join. Yet, despite this, I could feel my mood slipping gradually. I have always been a shy person and not good with strangers, but I began to feel a creeping anxiety looming up on me, that told me to not bother others, that by interacting with others I was causing them inconvenience and discomfort, and the best thing for me to do was to just be alone. I partly attribute it to the fact I had a really awful teacher in my first semester here. Now, I think some people might think that this might be a cultural shock issue, but I am pretty sure that she was crossing ANY acceptable line, no matter what culture. Firstly she would be very rude to me in front of all my classmates. Say if I came in without makeup, in jeans (like, still showered, hair done, not sweatpants or anything, just not completely dolled up) she would say in front of everyone 'Your face isn't pretty enough to not wear any makeup. You are scaring everyone. You know girls in Japan care about their appearance. You should do too, for everyone's sake'. (Also my Japanese is perfectly adequate to understand interactions like that, so I know for a fact that this wasn't a language barrier issue. ) If I got a question wrong in class she would say 'You know, I don't know why I bother asking planyourspontaneity for answers, she is so useless'. Or if we had to make example sentences she would pick examples like 'What does planyourspontaneity need? Oh planyourspontaneity needs to learn how to make some friends'. And this became like a running joke in my class. I have never been bullied, so I never learnt to grow a thick skin, so this (what felt like) daily victimisation began to really grate and tear down my self esteem. I felt isolated so my social anxiety caused me to isolate myself, and people ignoring me, creating a vicious circle. I began to be completely mute in class, ignoring the teacher, be on my phone, having headphones in, and this obviously spurred her on as she would berate me for how I was a terrible student. Also I feel like it might be relevant to say how I told this teacher that the reason why I was so withdrawn and using my phone a lot was because my stepfather was undergoing cancer treatment and I was worried (this was true). But she still kept calling me useless and 'the worst student I have ever taught' to everyone. If I seemed withdrawn though she would stroke my thighs and lower back and neck (I think this contact thing might be a cultural difference but still) in front of everyone, which obviously made them think I was a total freak. If I made eye contact with them, they would quickly shuffle away or look disgusted. Around November-ish time I began to suffer with very extreme bouts of depression. I felt awfully ashamed- here I was living the dream I had longed for for about a decade, and I was here for some reason feeling absolutely dreadful. Even if I had had a fun day, I still had this lingering sadness, and I would get home and cry. I started seeing a counsellor which was one of the best decisions (or rather, my long distance boyfriend decided for me) I ever made. In December time it reached the point where I would barely go to class because the idea of seeing people, going to class, and even just getting out of my bed",reddit_train.csv
"Post: No lodging for the sad Being depressed sucks. That's easy to grasp. Most people who aren't clinically depressed understand this. What they don't understand is that being depressed and honestly trying to get better is extremely difficult, and our ruggedly individualistic society doesn't give a single fuck about you. You need help? Fuck you. Your wealth isn't just something you have, it's seen as a reflection of your worth as a person. Poor? Sad? Find it difficult to wake up? Find it difficult to complete things? Do you procrastinate because of underlying psychological issues? Fuck you, you're just lazy. The clear message capitalism sends me is that if I can't work, or I can't work enough, or I can't work doing a ""high value job"", or if I need help to get better so that I can do those ""high value jobs"", I probably ought to just go die, because I'm clearly worth nothing.",reddit_train.csv

At him for leaving my best friend a 26 year old widow, at the people who raised him, at society, for telling him it’s weak to take medicine, at whatever the fuck higher power may be responsible for this stupid, senseless waste.

"Post: For the first time in my life i liked this girl and when she left life around me doesn't make sense. Why does this pain happen to people This is my first time and please i need some answers on what to do, why does life work this way, i fucking hate that things had to go wrong this fucking way. My depression is taking over me and my family is worried about me. For the first time in high school i liked this girl for about 7 months and during that time we became best friends and i always thought she would like me if i cared for her and treated her right. i always acted the same way as her and found out we thought the same sometimes. We always talked to each other including late night till 2 or 3 am and we knew everything about each other and we always were with each other but instead she liked some asshole who didn't like me and always kept lying about me to her. She never believed what he said about me but chose to love him and be with him more and they always were with each other after class and it made me jealous and angry on why she would do this. One day i invited her to some place with her and my friends but she decided to also want to take the asshole and i got frustrated and ended our friendship. she got angry at me and decided to leave too. but one day the asshole decided to leave her because of a fight they had and she starts crying to me on the phone and i try to help her get over him but it hurts me when she says she loves this person who kept lying to her about me and other things and he was known to be a bad person and she only dated one guy before but he was super nice and i didn't understand why she liked him and she said she didn't either, it was only that she felt happy around him. She is such a pretty girl and most of the guys in the school agree and thought me and her were dating but they never knew she really liked this asshole and during the time they hanged out she kept asking me if they were right for each other and she said she would separate from him but she didn't listen to me. Instead they got closer and me and this asshole got into more fights with each other but she would rather not say anything and still be with him. Now she is actually separating from him after all this time. Why did she do this to me after everything we've been through because i treated her way better but she did this to me and i dont know should i go back to her after what she did. Its been 2 weeks and i haven't talked to her since then and my mind has been thinking of ways to beat myself up because of this problem. Everyone knows im depressed but at this point i couldn't care and im losing my mind and i just need some answers of why she liked this asshole but not me.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I want to die [trigger warning] [Trigger Warning] My trauma happened when i was 8, I'm now 18 and still suffer from it daily. I actually suppressed the trauma completely until I was 12, when it all came back to me; so I guess I've only really been dealing with it for 6 years now. I have severe PTSD, severe depression, anxiety, severe panic/anxiety attacks, OCD, severe memory loss, and had an intense eating disorder for 6 years that I'm still struggling with constantly. I haven't gotten a good nights' sleep in years. I have constant PTSD nightmares, regular nightmares, and insomnia/constant fatigue and exhaustion. I also disassociate a lot and self harmed for years. Currently clean from self harm for about a year and a half. I've been admitted to a hospital because of all of my mental problems, and honestly wish I could go back sometimes. I was gaslighted for years to believe that my trauma was normal. My home environment was constantly hostile. I go through long periods of feeling suicidal. Currently in that period. Don't know what to do, honestly. Years of being in therapy and being prescribed pills and yet I still am nowhere near being close to healthy. Looking back, I can't even remember the last time I was genuinely happy. The periods of my sadness last longer than my periods of calm. I'm so afraid of waking up when I'm 40 and still feeling the same way I do now. The thing about being an adult that spent their entire teenage years thinking they would have killed themselves by now is realizing that your mental illnesses have real repercussions. I have fucked bones and a fucked stomach because of an eating disorder that lasted so long and a GED because I couldnt find the will to do schoolwork when I was just trying to find the will to live another day and not cut myself again. I can’t afford college because I didn’t do any extracurriculars to get scholarships because the thought of having to stay after school made me want to have a panic attack and i just wanted to sleep. I have no friends because when people invited me to hang out my anxiety made me cry myself to sleep instead. I didn’t have any real thought-out “grand plans” because I was too busy hurting myself and getting high and wanting to kill myself to really sit down and plan things out. I said I wanted to do things but never took the time to think it all through. It doesnt seem fair that I went through this trauma, had/have all of this mental illness, and now have to do with the repercussions of those illnesses. It doesnt seem fair that I'm suffering so much still. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of trying so fucking hard. I know this is self-pitying and 'emo' but I just don't know what to do. I have no one to talk to. I really just want to die.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Am I Depressed? While I've been distraught and suicidal on and off since age fifteen, I've never been formally diagnosed with anything because I don't trust the mental-health establishment. I've only visited a shrink twice: once when forced by parents, a second time when pressured by a partner. Because of this, I'm reluctant to claim I'm depressed except in the loose, colloquial sense. Instead, I feel my rage and despair flow quite appropriately from my failure to fulfill my desires, achieve my dreams, and so on. I hate being alive and would adore a sudden death, sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm depressed, right? I don't experience many of the symptoms of formal depression: I sleep pretty well most of the time, I eat okay, and I'm socially active. (I feel abjectly isolated, but empirically I spend a fair amount of time with friendly acquaintances at events and so on.) I resist the medical model of my mental state because it assumes the problem's with me rather than with the world. I figure I'd be okay if I had the basic level of social success normal folks have: a number of close friends and a healthy romantic/sexual relationship with one or more partners. I'm becoming increasingly confident my genetics and values combine to make forming meaningful connections with other humans effectively impossible. Because I yearn for such connections intensely, it's only rational that this dynamic would make my life unlivable. I'm not depressed. My brain ain't malfunctioning; it's as valid a pattern as any. The uncaring universe approves of my mind as much as anyone's. I'm just not biologically equipped to thrive in the environments I find myself in.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Me [28F] and my husband [29M] don't want children. His parents disagree with our decision so much that they want him to divorce me. For the past year, I've been weathering constant and continuous passive-aggressive attacks from my husband's parents. This issue has largely stemmed from our refusal to have children. They have also been contacting my parents, stating that they have issues with things we've said/done (mainly baby-related) and when we've tried bringing up the issue they lie and say they don't know what we're talking about and act like we're overreacting/being crazy/too sensitive. Recently, after his parents did and said multiple things in a short period of time, my husband tried to confront them again (not for the first time). During the conversation, his parents said some truly horrible (and in my opinion, unforgivable) things about me: They said that my refusal to have children (which my husband totally supports, and agrees with as he also doesn't want children) made me an abusive, mentally ill, toxic person and told my husband to divorce me. They also gave him an ultimatum: them or me. The conversation was not received well by my husband, and he, of course, chose me. He's very angry with his parents as they've refused to listen to and respect his wishes. However, they then decided to contact my parents to inform them of the mentally ill, toxic, abusive daughter that they'd raised because I wouldn't give them grandchildren. My parents, of course, were bewildered and tried to explain that we were happy, and that if we didn't want children, that decision should be respected. My husband's parents have not taken kindly to any of those suggestions. My husband and I have been together for five years, and are coming up to being married for three. I have made it clear to everyone involved that I don't want children, and I never have. My husband agreed and has always supported and agreed with this decision. At the moment, no one is really speaking to anyone, and I'm taking it rather hard. It's devastating to realise that his parents only ever liked or valued me as a 'person' when I was a uterus that was potentially giving them grandchildren. To hear from my parents that they're furious that I've disrupted the plans that they had for their son upsets me on so many levels that I can't even explain properly. I am no longer sleeping or eating properly. If it were me, and they weren't my husband's parents, I would cut them completely out of my life and never speak or associate with them again. While my husband feels like this is a great solution, I also feel that they are still his parents, and no matter how angry he currently is, he's going to want a relationship in the future. My question is - how do I do? How can I try and move forward with people who literally won't accept me unless I bear them grandchildren? How can I ever let go of the fact that they've made it abundantly clear to me, my husband, and my parents, that they view me as a uterus, not a person? I want to do the right thing by my husband and be supportive, but I'm completely lost in this situation, and I have honestly no idea how to move forward. --- **tl;dr**: My in-laws won't speak to me because I don't want children. They've threatened my husband with an ultimatum (them or me) and have insisted he leaves me immediately. What do I do? What advice is there for trying to move forward - especially with people who won't address me unless I give them grandchildren?",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Why do I pick the worst friends? This is an absolute rant: I am frustrated and I don't have any friends apparently to work through this with so Reddit it is! What do you know? There I'd convieniantly a sub-reddit for this very issue I am having. First of all, I want to start off by saying, all of my friends are not terrible. The majority of them, yes. I feel like friends are supposed to add value and positive energy to your life and that is not happening in mine. It has been becoming clear over the last few months and I think I need to figure out how to dump these friends that drain me. Here are some examples. I will use letters instead of their names. Friend A. I have known A for about 10 years now. We worked together for many years. We partied together for many years. We have kept in contact for many years. I didn't see A as much when I moved about a half hour away. Life happens. Things happen. People get busy and I totally understand that. I drive, she STILL doesn't. We still remained friends though. However..... I am the one who checks up on her and messages to simply see how things are or invite her somewhere. She gets a hold of me when she needs a ride or something. I can't remember a time she has ever just called or texted to say hi and ask me how life is. I like A because she is pretty easy to talk to. We have had a lot of good times and have made a ton of memories. One thing that I always tried to look past is her utter lack of manners. I don't think in my ten years of knowing her I have ever heard her mutter a thank you. All of the things I have done for her, never once was there a thank you. I have given her tons and tons of rides and she has offered gas money and I never received a dime. I never expected a dime but if you are going to offer it at least honor your word. What really prompted this post was something that happened today. A is pregnant and she is due sometime in January. I hadn't heard from any of our mutual friends about planning a shower so I messaged her best friend and asked If she had thought about doing so. Her best friend hadn't even given it any thought. .... she said if I would like to take the reigns and plan it then she would help but had no interest in planning the party. I thought it was a little odd but I felt like A really should have a baby shower. I reached out to a few more people who I thought might have the same idea and they hadn't thought to do it either. I'll be honest, I am not a party planner. .. not even close. The thought of entertaining/interacting/etc with people makes me super anxious.... BUT all that aside... she is my friend and she deserves to be thrown a baby shower. I have been thinking about ideas over the past few weeks but haven't put anything into motion yet. I get a message from her today over Facebook that says: ""So H informed me you guy were gonna plan a babyshower for me...well we was unaware so C and R are getting together to do one...so if you would like get in touch with one of them and details can be worked out....we just know we are having it October 14th"" I read it. My first initial reaction was annoyance. Since then it has progressed... I think I would have been less annoyed if there was a ""but thank you for thinking of me anyways"" or something along those lines. There is not one ounce of gratitude in this message. I'm kind of annoyed with myself for expecting there to be any at all. One would think I would have learned by now. So, I guess the point of this rant is for me to figure out what I need to do about all of this. My gut is telling me it's time to ditch the ungrateful, mannerless nonsense. The other part is sad to lose a ""friend"". Are my expectations too high? Is it wrong of me to expect my friends to have basic manners? Please, any and all advice is welcomed.",reddit_train.csv

I've always been an outgoing, funny, talkative and very active guy and i just felt as is i runned out of batery like something was leaving me without lifeforce. After some therapy i decided to tell my mother about this. I went for a visit to my parents house and waited until we were alone to tell her basically what i've been writing above. Also told her that the biggest fear i had before doing it was that if i died my mother would also died just out of pure sadness. After we both cried for a while she dropped the bomb. She had been struggling with depression all her life without me or my sister knowing about it and it came a point where she even tried of doing the same. The thing that stopped her was their children and what we would do with 12 and 8 years alone. She also told me that my grandfather didn't die of cancer, apparently he was an alcoholic, and when we where kids he threw himself at the well they had on the backyard. All this just made me realize that people don't kill themselves, depression kills people the same way cancer does. People who haven't struggled with this can't even imagine what is living with depression and often blame a person who is basically ill. My mother also gave me the best advice i've ever recieved. She told me that I wasn't on this earth just to find a job and live the best way i could just by buying things, that it didn't matter if i didn't find a huge reason to live; just by being there i was already the reason for my mother and many others to live and be happy, the same way she was for me. That even just by smiling at the guy at the supermarket i was already making him a bit happier even though it would only be a few seconds, and that should be enough.

"Post: Anyone else read books as a form of escapism? I know for some people depression can be so crippling that you can’t even find the motivation to pick up a book let alone focus long enough to read it. That used to be me although I’ve always been interested in reading and loved it until my depression became that crippling. But since getting put on adderall for my ADD, I’m able to get back into reading books. Mostly fantasy books It helps me literally be in another world for a while and forget about my problems for a while and feel like I’m living another life for a while. It’s not a cure obviously for depression but it does seem to help me a little temporarily. Anyone else have a reading habit or have found reading to be helpful in this way ?? And if so, what do you like to read ?",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I feel as though eventually I am going to kill myself I’ve told a couple friends this. They’ve told me that I need to see my therapist more, and that I need to get back on my meds. But what if I’m content with this thought? I don’t remember the last time I was truly happy. At best I’m content. Most of the time though I’m in a shitty mood. I don’t really give a fuck anymore that people might be upset that I’d commit suicide. I definitely don’t give a fuck when people get worried when I say that I’m gonna do it eventually. It is what is. I’m not happy, I never will be. When I tell my therapist that I’ll never be happy he asks me if I can predict the future. Obviously I fucking can’t but if the last 15 years have been any indication of what my happiness is gonna be then it ain’t gonna get any better With all of that said, and here I go contradicting myself, but all of what I’ve just previously wrote scares the absolute shit out of me. I’m terrified that I’m starting to give less of a fuck. Also, while I don’t think I’ll ever truly be happy, I still have hope that I will be one day. But it’s not looking good",reddit_train.csv

"Post: I feel like I’m spiraling downwards. I’m losing people and can’t do anything about it or do the wrong things. I’m just searching desperately for someone to care before it’s too late. This summer has just flown by. I work so much and made the mistake of taking multiple summer classes. I spend every moment I can trying to do fun things with my friends but many times it’s not as much as I’d like. My best friend is stationed overseas, and while I have a close group of friends I’ve known for years, literally all of them are doing something this fall that takes them elsewhere. When they are gone, I’m going to be all by myself. I’ve been so lonely lately too. Just wanting someone to care about me. I had it and fucked it all up at the beginning of the year, and I just regret it all the time. I drink by myself a lot at night to deal with the loneliness, but it makes it worse. This summer has already just been shitty, but at least my friends are around. It’s like fall is just a ticking time bomb at this point. No matter how hard I try to talk to someone new it never goes my way and I’m always left on read or stood up on plans. The other night, I got drunk and did something I’ve never done before, and that was cut myself. Honestly, I feel like I did it to see if I could, and how it would make me feel. I guess I still don’t know how it does, but I was disappointed in myself I let it get so far. I don’t know. I just feel like this year has just been me slowly losing the only things that make me happy.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Advice on where to post for advice on taking antidepressants. Hi, UK based poster - I've recently taken my Doctors advice and got a prescription for antidepressants. I've been in-and-out of various states of mild to severe depression throughout my teens &amp; twenties, but I've always figured this is just something everyone has to deal with at some stage or another, so I've never sought help even when falling off a proverbial cliff edge. After much deliberation, someone I care deeply about got me to try counselling, but I find that I'm really not getting much out of it right now, as I don't have the will to try, and my focus is all over the place (I'm being tested for ADHD too, but I'm still awaiting the results). My Doctor suggested trying a combination of antidepressants and CBT (the latter of which I am currently attempting to source a support group for), however I have an underlying phobia of long-term medication after seeing several people close to me, use it as a crutch and just become something wholly unfamiliar to me as a result. I've been prescribed Citalopram (Celexa for those stateside) but like I said - I have deep-seated reservations about taking them and before I tried, I wanted to see if there was anywhere/anyone I could talk to about their experiences on the drug and any perhaps any suggestions they could offer about managing short-term (6-9 months) antidepressant medication? I've looked at the sub-reddit rules for this group and I'm not sure if this crosses rule 3; if so, can someone help me find the right place to ask my question(s)?",reddit_train.csv
"Post: How to break up with my depressed/suicidal girlfriend? I’m in a tough position... I fell for a girl over 6 months ago and we’ve been dating since. It’s faded for me at least, and I don’t feel the same way I did at all, but from what she’s told me her feelings for me have only gotten stronger and we’ve already hit the “I love you” stage. I still care for her as a person and there’s nothing bad between us nor do we argue, but it’s just not what it was and I feel like I’ve needed to move on for the past 2-3 months. My issue with this is the fact that she’s both depressed and has been suicidal in the past (not things I knew off the bat, but learned towards the beginning). She has 1 real friend and a sibling she’s close to, but aside from that she doesn’t get along with her family. She’s told me before I’m really all she has, but not in a desperate way (although I think it is that too). I don’t really know how to tell her or what to be cautious of because this is the first time I’ve dated someone like this. I know it’s a shitty situation but I need to move on in a way that leaves her the least impacted or in the best way I can.

"Post: I don't want to exist anymore My girlfriend has left me a couple of months ago, saying she doesn't love me anymore but without explaining me why. I then tried to ask her out one last time, not to come back together, just to clarify what happened. She doesn't want to see me and when I write to her she answers back just so that I can't say she's ignoring me and she continuously provokes me to get into an argument. I really had trusted her, and she had done the same, until a couple of months ago (she's always told me I was the only person who she actually trusted, even after we split up) so I feel like I've been used and then thrown away like an object. I then realized I'm not good at all at socializing, that she was the only truly important person in my life (except for other two friends of mine, who have their own lives and whom I don't want to annoy too much with my problems) and that I will probably never know anyone else in my life. Every day I feel like I'm bothering other people and I'm not doing anything good, and probably this is the reason nobody wants to become my friend. I don't want to commit suicide, but often I find myself thinking how better it would be if I stopped existing...",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I'm just so fucking lonely and I'm tired of pretending I'm fine Fair warning I'm about to just spill out everything I have bottled up into this post I'm so tired of being alone I can't bare it anymore. My depression and anxiety is slowly killing me. I'm a 23 year old male, trying to restart my adult life in college after many failed attempts at succeeding anywhere else. I work and I go to school, I see hundreds of smiling and happy faces, and I feel like I'm not even really there with them. Like a one way mirror where I see them but I'm never seen. I have no friends. I used to be a part of rather large group of friends, but as of now I couldn't tell you the last time I talked to any of those people. They've either moved on and some of them are no longer on this earth. I have acquaintances with people at work, but they have their own life to live and when it's time to clock out, again I am left to go home alone and broken. The only person I ""have"" is my mother, and she tends to make matters worse when I try to open. I'm also desperately single. I haven't been in a relationship, let alone just dated someone, in years. And it's soul crushing. I see all these happy couples around campus, beautiful men and women, having the time of their lives with each other. And I'm so fucking jealous man. I want that happiness so desperately bad. I want to love someone, I want to FEEL loved! I want someone to help me through days like today, and to be there for them when they have those days. I want the cheesy shit like cuddling and laughing over stupid stuff. I want the inevitable times where we're pissed at each other about something, but we work through it and end up going crawling up next to each other in bed at the end of the night, and wake up to see each other to start the day. I'm tired of waking up to this massive empty bed, cold and alone. But most of all, I'm tired of pretending. Of having to pretend. To wear this mask every single fucking day of my life just to pretend to be normal. Just so my coworkers won't think I'm weird. Just so my mom won't go off about how I just need to get my shit together. Just so I can hold up the chance that one day I'll be able to overcome my massive wall of social anxiety and try to talk to someone, make a friend, maybe meet a girl. All in all I'm tired of pretending I'm happy, that I'm fine. BECAUSE IM NOT FUCKING FINE! I'm not happy, I'm slowly dying over here and I can't take this shit anymore. I desperately want to change. I desperately want to live a ""normal"" life, and I just keep sinking further and further down while everyone else passes me by. I guess my rant is over.

"Post: In law family vacation + newborn My husband and I have been married since August 2016. I am now pregnant due in April. We have been going on vacation with his parents for the last 3 yrs with his 2 sisters and last year their husband's too. They assume that we will be going on vacation this year too, the baby would be 4 months old I DONT WANT TO GO. FYI, his dad is great and hands off and his mom is very opinionated and gives too much advice but she means well and has been nothing but good to me. Reasons I don't want to go 1. We have lived with them for the past 5 months, I need a vacation from THEM. I am used to my own space and being able to retreat, I no longer really have that. 2. It will be a 4 hr car ride with a four month old. It may not be that big a deal but other than the car ride, I just rather be home and comfortable and not in another state staring at a beach for 7 days that I don't even want to be at. 3. My husband's older sister has gone out of her way to make me feel excluded in the past and said borderline mean comments. We made some headway last year but I barely tolerate her and avoid her and really don't want to be stressed out for 7 days because of it plus taking care of My baby. Everyone else doesn't see this, or sees her aggressive behavior as assertive. 4. I don't even know why I've gone the last 3 years as by the 3rd day I am drained. I am trying to better listen to myself instead of forcing myself to endureeat something I don't have to My question is how do I tell them we are not going (my husband is backing me 100%) specially cause I know my MIL will resist Do you guys think it's ok that I don't want to go",reddit_train.csv

"Post: In the mood to vent So I'm gonna make this self deprivating post quick. I was a sick child. Shit was fucked. Too young to understand what was going on and had lots of surgeries and what not. I possibly have autism, I was diagnosed with sensory processing disorder to get O.T. however I think they gave me that so I wasn't stuck with the label of autism. I think they believed I was too young to be diagnosed and so I never got a checkup from a psychiatrist after O.T. . So it's possible I'm autistic but idk. Anyway my childhood was shit. Absolute fucking garbage. I was the loser kid. Had physical issues so I never left the house. I was ugly and fat. My entire childhood was just a big fucking waste of time. Anyway I become 16 and start hanging around bad kids. At this point I lost all fucks to give about my schooling. My social skills were finally developed enough so I can make friends but I didn't really like any of them. I started getting a prescription for drugs. It wasn't very difficult given my medical history. Started taking Adderall daily. And my mom would occasionally give me some Xanax she had. Also started drinking. I guess some warning signs for a shitty life but idk. I'm not entirely sure what to do at this point. I plan on going to community college since I'm probably gonna drop out of HS soon.

"Post: Im wasting my life As a 15 year old currently, I feel like i'm entirely disconnected from every human soul on this planet. I cannot properly have social interactions with others without me overthinking stuff that person says. What I mean is, if a ""friend"" tells me i'm dumb jokingly, I take it at heart. I take everything too literal, I cannot properly talk to others without me being awkward and silent. I cannot talk to people if I have ignore them constantly, if someone addresses me so they can talk to me, I sometimes ignore them and pretend like I never heard them. If a person says hi to me, I stay silent. I'll never get a girlfriend, i'll never feel a girls hand, or the feeling of affection, comfort, and attention. I never even got to talk to a girl before. Seeing everyone at school socializing with their girlfriend, hugging them, doing everything for them, absolutely destroys me as a person. I can see why I got bullied. Those times I was called ""Pussy"" ""Weak"" ""Retarded"" turned out to be true. The physical bullying I received, when they pulled my hair and embarrassed me in front of everyone in class by flipping me off my chair. I understand now, the stuff I deserve. I can see why my dad abondoned me ever since I was born, he was never there for me, I don't know what type of man he is or how he looks like. The brothers and sisters I never met, which I dearly wish I could. They're all so young, I wish I could have been a big brother for them. I hate living in isolation and loneliness. As if I wasn't lonely enough at school, but now at home. Everyone takes their brothers and sisters for granted, but a person like me would love one of those. My grandparents and mom say they love me, which I do believe, but I still feel no more or less that same, it doesn't matter in the end. I cannot do simple activities at school that involve groups, no because a person could possibly screw it up for us, but because I need to socialize. I cannot do sports because it involves me being around people and I absolutely despise it. What am I so afraid of? Being judged? Why am I here? What am I? It doesn't matter, I still die in the end anyways. Maybe taking my own life is the answer, it resolves all the pain I have received. Who cares what my so called family feels? They must know its for my own personal benefit, they should realize that when I do eventually end myself, that I will no longer feel the pain I once received. I never have felt an emotional connection between any of my family, they're doing their own thing in their life. Nobody at school would care, I only have two friends. Ones I hold dear because they understand my pain. Looks are deceiving aren't they? A lot of people in my school consider me attractive and cute, but good does that do me? I won't get any benefit from it either way. A bit of a description of how I look like, long hair, feminine face, a thin appearance (not super thin, I weigh about 130). But anyways, I simply plan on ending my own life sooner or later, I don't know how long I can last. We have no value, no significant purpose of existing, so might as well end it now.

"Post: Long Winded Post From a Failed 30 Year Old I don't even necessarily want to write this but I need to clear my head. I've been a depressed pissant for as long as I could remember. Some of my youngest memories are melancholic and sickly devoid of confidence or even reason. I grew up dirt poor. I remember spending a night pushing a needle through the rubber of my shoes to get the sole back on. My mom had a stroke and an aneurysm but survived. Sort of. She became a wicked, wicked creature who loved pitting me against my sibling and I never came out on top. My entire life has been from the cowering creature perspective. Life isn't experienced but something that happens to me. I joined the Army at 18. I had gotten recklessly married a month prior to shipping to basic. I ended up fucking up and missing a bus which led to a Lemony Snicket series of Unfortunate Events type shit. I went through partial infantry brainwashing but never made it past the build-up. So I ended my career, the only thing I've wanted to do, before it even took off. Luckily, it was more of a ""this isn't working so we'll forget it happened"" type deal and my enlistment ended without anything terrible. But I never recovered. At least back then I had some sort of tenacity. Now? I'm a fucking shell, mate, of what I was. A completely hollow individual. I'm 30 years old. I've no education. I have no passions. I used to enjoy writing but I can't bring myself to write anymore. The moment I try I go back into wounded animal mode. No, this isn't good enough. Nope, neither is this. Why bother? Why try? I can't help but think these things. I'm still married and that is the only reason I haven't killed myself. I did try early on because of relentless hounding from my father in law. It is obvious I'm not what he wanted for his daughter. I can't figure out why I'm alive at all. I can barely live my life. I'm depressed constantly. No matter how happy I know I should be or how wide I smile I'm in the grey of storm clouds that seemed, at least until this subreddit, to be only over my head. I've had so many jobs that I just explosively quit. I've got Intermittent Explosive Disorder as well as depression and anxiety. So I coil up and wind tightly before my brain dumps chemicals that make me explode with no regard for the damage done. I'm currently unemployed. I left my last job like that. I loved my job. I loved the guy I worked for. I earned several raises within a few months and was promoted quickly because I threw my back into that work. It has been too long though. I can't seem to find another job. I can't even bring myself to apply anymore. I don't have a car. I ""rent"" a couple rooms off the main house of my inlaws. I failed so hard in giving my wife a life worth living. She spends her time working and though understands and doesn't mind my unemployment it is killing me. On Dec.12th I lost all interest in anything. I used to escape in video games but now I can't. I load up Ark and just stare. I've anxiety about everything. Recently installed Heroes of the Storm and I played a mean Lili and Abathaur but now I've got butterflies even playing against bots. The smallest, most simple of tasks seems beyond me. I'm stupider than I used to be. How I interpret the simplest of sentences or instruction is out of whack. I have trouble reading though I've got tons of read Omnibuses from Warhammer 40k on my bookshelf. I have trouble speaking. I talk slowly and can barely push out the words off my tongue. I'm only recently able to make phonecalls without losing my mind anxiety wise. I'm so full of regret. I hate what I became. I hate that I married someone and am dragging them through the mud. To never have a real apartment or car. I can't hold a job. I barely take care of the house. I do dishes now but it is a real struggle. I've been thinking a lot more about suicide and I'm already sure I am too cowardly to really do it but I think about it a lot. How it'd hurt my wife but I think it'd be good for her to find someone else. I just don't see the point in continuing. I'm an adult now but I never learned how to properly be an adult. I don't know what to do. There is a burning hole in my chest and I feel guilty that I'm the way that I am. Even on the subreddit. I know people feel that people who've a significant other can't be as depressed but I'm swimming at the bottom of the barrel. I want this all to end. I don't know how to survive. I don't know how people manage it. I don't have that self-preservation sense that keeps people going despite it all. I'm weak. I am weak in ways that I can barely accept. I struggle a lot with the fact 22 veterans a day kill themselves but I'm still around. I carry endless guilt that better people die and I'm still alive. Goddamn it. People are dying from diseases and cancers while I exist. While I can't so much as go outside without feeling like all eyes are boring holes into my psyche. I hate that all I do is sit here and lay in bed. I hate myself. I feel if I don't get this out, even if it is never seen by anyone, I will implode. I'm on medication and it helped my depression but then the reality",reddit_train.csv

"Post: All my friends have left me behind My best friends at school got new computers that can run AAA games and it was my idea. They soon all got gta and im stuck with this laptop. After this things started going downhill. i wasnt getting added to skype calls, when i asked, they said ""gta players only"" and when i slipped in one time i asked ""when are you guys ever going to play with me again"" either they didnt say anything or said ""i dont know"" and then one of my friends said ""we will play with you at school"". I have school tommorow btw. This has occured 4 days ago and each day i have gotten more sad. I have been trying to cope for it by trying to find new friends (which i did but they live in other countries so its hard to find playtimes) and also contacting old friends. I have asked my friends each day if they wanted to play and they say idk or maybe. i dont want to kill myself but i dont want it to come to that.

"Post: Too cowardice or just selfish? So English is not my first language so there might be some grammar mistakes but this has been bugging me for a while now. There was this girl I met some time during my last year of middle school and I guessed she took an interest in me, I was pretty confused as I wasn't the type to stand out much and I wouldn't talk at all unless someone comes up and starts a conversation with me. And she was the one to do that - uh, during a school graduation ceremony, of course. After that, we went to different high schools but still kept in touch. So overtime, after the graduation, we kind of became close, as friends. Well I didn't have many friends to start with so I spent a lot of time talking to her about all kind of stuff and I was devoted, if she was sad I would spend my day trying to cheer her up or yes, I wouldn't push her to say what was on her mind if she didn't want to share but yeah, I could do anything to make her happy because as I said before, I didn't have many friends, I was bullied and she was the first one to be so kind to me - all my ""friends"" kind of just sided with the bullies when they knew I was the target. At one point, I thought I was in love with her. But that was the part I would feel guilty whether it came up, I thought because she was the popular type, and she had a boyfriend, dating her was something I could never do. But then she broke up with her boyfriend (it was some kind of argument over some disagreements iirc), I was happy about it but it just wasn't the right time, she was sad and she would spent the whole summer the following year after we met just talking with me about stuff and as we could do some drawings, we kind of made a world of our own and we would stay up until 2 in the morning everyday just to think of a concept for that universe (it's like making a comic or something, I'm a big nerd for world concepts) so it was like I was bonded with her. Anyways I think I'm being too informative about this so I'll just skip to the main point. After that, about 6 months or so I tried to be an understanding friend and I didn't take a single opportunity to try to flirt with her as I knew I would be a dick if I had done that - well because I thought I shouldn't pressure her into a relationship whereas she just got out of one. So anyways, after a year, she got over it, I thought it was the right time for me but I didn't have the confidence to confess because I was overprotective of her as she didn't/doesn't have a good family and I was more like a big brother to her, because she was the one who wasn't good with dealing problems and I've lived my whole life dealing with all kinds of problems so I had a good view of dealing with them (I won't go into details as it would be another really long story) - So the idea of us dating was kind of ridiculous - I still don't know if she ever felt the same way. So I tried to change for the better, I went out to socialize more (it was exhausting but hey, there are things you would do for love), I worked out to lose weight so she doesn't feel embarrassed if we were to get together (she doesn't say it but I know she doesn't even want to date a fat guy) - I wanted to be a good partner for her, I know I wouldn't be the best but I could try. I tried to be someone reliable because I know full well she kind of looked down on me, how she tried to prove that she's better than me at everything (she is, at some fields). But the distressing part was that she started changing, she is still popular (yup, up until now), but she had more outbursts, she was constantly crying and whether I came up to ask her what was wrong she would throw a fit at me so I thought I was invading her privacy too much so I didn't say anything anymore, I was just there, trying to be supportive. So for the second time, I let go of another opportunity for a girlfriend. (you can actually skip the first two parts but I just felt like going into details, sorry) The third time, I thought it was time to make a move and she met a girl and fell in love with her instantly, I was supportive of her regardless. The latter one was also attracted to her so I thought just what kind of person would be so selfish to stop their bestfriend from getting in another relationship. I mean, honestly, I never had any luck with girls so I could just wait for later, her being happy was my priority. Yeah, so ever since I tried to change, I was better at talking. So I helped them get together, how to reply just to get the other one to be her girlfriend. And after that, our friendship was getting better. I thought I was the happiest person at the time, but another part of me was devastated. That part was well hidden for quite some time but it grew, it hated her girlfriend, it hated the fact that I was being too devoted and never got anything in return (I didn't quite expect anything in return from the start but I guess my feelings piled up). And before I knew",reddit_train.csv

Ive made it clear that Im a democrat, to which they just call me a snowflake all the time, which just makes me resent them even more. I dont dare tell them Im am atheist, but Im thinking about it. I dont have anything to live for anymore. I dont have any idea what to do with my life. I dont have any special talent or skills. The only hobby I really have is video games, but Im horrible at those. I've raged so hard at Battlefield that I broke down in tears and drooled everywhere, and anytime I play an RPG I restart so many times that it makes me not want to play anymore. All my friends have at least an idea of what they want to do, but I dont even have the beginnings of a clue as to what I want to do with the rest of my life. And to be honest, Im scared of becoming an adult. Managing a budget, doing taxes, paying bills, and shit like that. Im not fucking prepared for it. If I cant deal with the stress of a fucking video game, then I sure as hell cant deal with a job. My parents are also hounding me to get a girlfriend. I dont even have a friend who is a girl. All my close friends are male. Hell, the closest Ive came to having a full conversation with a girl is helping her with spanish homework. I aint gay, I just cant talk to girls. The social anxiety makes me want to vomit if I even think about approaching a girl. So Im ready to fuck it all and just tell my parents Im an atheist.

"Post: Asian parents, jealousy, what to do? Hello I am an asian american son trying to help out my family. My family from Vietnam moved here 5 months ago and have been living together with my Mom and Dad. I no longer live at home, and couldn't live at home if I wanted to because of the space and my relatives here for the first time to America, which is fine with me. I recently found out about drama going on at home, it involves my mom and dad and my female cousin. About one ago before my relatives moved here from vietnam, something had happen to my great aunt , she had given advice to my mom about being careful about her husband and any woman in the house. What had happen to my great aunt was, she caught her husband trying to cheat with her niece. I'm not sure if they actually had an affair or whatnot, but just warning her to be careful about this type of situation in the house. I really feel like it was unfair for my great aunt to put these thoughts in my mom's head because why do that? Especially when they are about to come and move in and start a new life in America. So back to the drama, my dad has been super stress out calling me, telling me that he is unable to handle the situation anymore. He said my mom thinks he is looking at my female cousin in a inappropriate way. She happens to be 19 years old. My dad just thinks this is crazy, he works 2 jobs (15 hours a day) trying to pay mortgage and pay all the bills. My mom doesn't work and stays home. My dad has been calling me saying he only is able to sleep 4 hours a night because every time he comes home from work, my mom is always giving him a ear full, and hes to the point where he can't take it anymore and thinking about just continuing to pay the bills and living somewhere else. I tried to talk to my mom and want to be completely open minded about the situation, she just tells me that I dont know, and she can tell the way he acts at home. Her reasoning is, she just can tell by the way he looks at her. She said she knows that he won't ever take it that far by cheating, but its her being jealous which is causing all this drama. In the house consist of my female cousin, male cousin, aunt and uncle. Also my other aunt and uncle and my mom and dad. its a pretty full house, and my parents have been arguing every other night. My aunt called me tonight trying to keep the peace in the house and calm down both sides. My female cousin and her family has no idea this is going on. But most likely suspect something because of the arguing between my parents and im afraid they will find out whats going on soon enough, which will be really embarrassing. I feel like my mom and dad need marriage counseling, or my mom needs to see a therapist, but being asian they don't believe in these types of counseling classes and will be very hard to get my mom to agree to do something like this. --- **tl;dr**: What can I do to help out my family? I'm not trying to take sides but I really don't think my dad would ever cheat on my mom. Every time I try to talk some sense Into my mom, she always ends up getting mad, and saying everyone thinks I'm crazy but I'm not. They have been married for 30 years and my dad has always worked two jobs his entire life to make sure all the bills are paid, that we have food and shelter.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Beautifully Broken I’ve spent most of my life afraid to be my true self because I believed that if I didn’t live up to the standards and norms that I grew up with, I wouldn’t be accepted. I was told since a young age how I should act, talk, and dress. I was told that money was important and that attending societal events and bullshit balls was your key to social success. And those things, trying to “feel” important, had meant everything to me. But then life screws you over and suddenly your perspective on everything changes. I learned that I no longer wanted to be the person that everyone said I had to be and things that had once seemed important became trivial. I realized that I didn’t give a fuck if I had Tory Burch shoes or a Chanel bag. No amount of money could ever bring me happiness, which was clearly evident in the money that was spent on “I’m sorry” shopping trips and my therapist. Things started falling apart at home when I was 15 years old. So my remedy to broken family was to drink until I couldn’t feel. But despite my new fond love of alcohol and its pain killing effects, I kept my life together. I worked hard in school, I stayed active in my community, and I made sure people thought I was keeping it together. I couldn’t let everyone know that I was a fucking mess. But in this process, I slowly lost myself and started living two different lives. When the curtains were wide open, people saw a girl that was very studious, had many accomplishment’s, and always had a smile on her face. But as soon as the curtains closed and I was alone, my demons came out. And the more I hid, the more I lost myself. At one point, the alcohol wasn’t enough. Things had only gotten worse at home and I needed a new escape. The first time I did it, it was a pair of scissors. It was small, barely noticeable. I had sworn after the first time that I would never hurt myself again. But eventually I did, and when I left for college it had only gotten worse. By my second year of college, I had reached my lowest point. I was in a toxic, emotionally abusive, relationship. I had a broken relationship with my parents, who spent most of their time stuck in a cycle of fighting, not speaking, and then pretending that they were okay. I hadn’t spoken to my older brother, a struggling addict at the time, in almost a year. I no longer knew who I was. So one night I went out and bought a bottle of wine with my fake ID and went back to my apartment and chugged the entire thing. I sat on my bathroom floor crying, staring at the knife in my hand. And in the back of my mind I thought about the gun that was a few feet away from me hidden in a book that my dad had given me for protection. For the first time in my life, I had looked at mortality straight in the face. I had questioned it many times, but it was never like that night. Eventually the crying stopped and the numbness came, a feeling I had become all too familiar with. Would I do it? Could I do it? Would anyone care? I was consumed with darkness, but there was a small flicker of light, of hope. I wanted to help people, I wanted to one day to change the world, or at the very least change one person’s life. I wasn’t ready to leave just yet, so I held on to the tiny amount of hope that was left in me. I called the cops and was admitted into a psychiatric center. I spent 48 hours in a white walled, emotionless, prison like place. And not once did someone ask me if I was okay. My parents came up to see me and had a difficult time accepting what had happened and I didn’t understand why. They knew I wanted help, they saw the scars on my arms, and they knew that I wasn’t okay. They blamed my relationship with my then boyfriend and told me to never speak of this to anyone. They didn’t want people to know I was “crazy”. Was I? During that time, I came to believe I was, but now I understand that I was just broken. It’s been over three years since that happened and although I still struggled with a lot after that, I’m now in a better place. The reason I am writing this is because I promised myself to one day help the 15-year-old me whose cries for help where tossed to the side, who was told she was over-dramatic and crazy, and who thought that cutting was the only way to cope. There was a reason I grew up surrounded by mental illness. I watched not only myself go through it, but I saw my brother, my parents, my friends, and so many people on the news struggling with their own demons. And this didn’t happen because life felt like fucking me over, it was just trying to show me what my reason for living is. I spent years ashamed of the person I was because I was scared to show people my true, raw, fucked up self. But isn’t that the problem? When it comes to having a mental illness, we believe the stigmas that come attached to it and we’re afraid to speak up and talk about it. And the people who are lucky enough to not experience it, don’t want to talk about it either. The only difference from how mental illness was treated a hundred years ago and now, is that we no longer hide and chain our family members in basements or attics,",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Awaiting the downward spiral. Had an awesome weekend with a whole bunch of friends from online who all came together, from all around Australia, for three days of drinking and festivities. Now I've travelled home and I'm all alone again. It's great that I have so many fantastic friends Online, but it's horrible we all live so far away. I'm already missing them terribly, and feeling down. I know that I'm about to spiral downwards even futher after having gotten drunk for three days. It's inevitable, but I'm trying to prepare. I'm going to try and draw, spend time with my Service Parrot and submerge myself in my gaming community. To keep myself as positively distracted as I can. I'm already trapped in an endless loop of thinking about my ex, who I still love and miss so much, and beating myself up. Searching for answers and ways how I could of been a better person for him. He told me he hated me and that I made him feel like a child. But i never intended for my help to make him feel like that. I tried to support and encourage him with everything. Emotionally and financially. I pushed myself to work 30+hrs a week when I was anxious and depressed because he became so closed off, so we had a roof over our head and food in our belly when we were made homeless. I tried to help him with being motivated to work, and to be able to support himself. I gave him every part of myself, because I loved him so much. And I keep holding on to things he said, before he forgot what this love really meant to him. And all the love that I gave to him, that never got into him. No matter how hard I tried. I wish he knew I don't hate him for what he said to me and that my suicide attempts weren't to make him feel guilty. I genuinely wanted to end my life. The thoughts of whatever I had done for him to hate me weighs so heavy upon me, that I fear to live with a guilt that was my own. I failed to be the person he wanted me to be, but worse; I failed to be the person I needed to be for him. Now we're 2000km apart and, Emotionally, I'm struggling to keep my head up. Financially, I know He's struggling too. Everyone keeps teling me I shouldn't care about him, but that just makes me hate myself more, that I do.

"Post: I am just confused what I should do or how I should act.(17M Asian)(Parent issues) My dad a man I dearly respect for his achievements and the hard work he does for my family, treats me like shit in comparison to my twin brother. Often seeing my dad trying to be cheerful when talking to my brother and transitioning to his normal angry and grumpy self towards me, I can't help to be jealous. In terms of general achievements my brother and I are leveled equally but my brother is self centered and like an ass hole to my dad. Remembering a event few days ago, my dad asked him to come to a restaurant with the family but refused to go, reasoning that he didn't believe in family ties and emotions, only to be found playing with his online buddies when walking in(this happens most week). Even then my dad tried his best to be cheerful towards him after dinner while I just got his tired grumpy looks. I am honestly thinking of just being a huge dick to my dad now and appeasing the retarded filial piety in my family. Any thoughts?",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Anyone ever look back at their younger years and wonder how they used to be such a joyful person? I saw a post on here about someone remembering a feeling of emptiness since they were five and just not knowing it was depression. For me it's the opposite. I was always a super joyful kid, and maybe a little too hyper. (I was that annoying kid when I was 10-11). Then around seventh grade I started to withdrawal from the world slightly, and just talked a little less than average. This seemed all fine at the time, it made me a more likable person. But I think that was the beginning. I finally realized my lack of a friend group because of how I acted when I was younger during third quarter that year. It wasn't bad depression, but it only got worse from there. My Dad turned from mean to abusive starting next year, and my mom started to be disappointed with everything I do. My parents don't even know anything about me besides a few keywords because they haven't held a conversation with me since I was 11. The only person who I can say genuinely cares for me is my best friend, and he doesn't even know I am depressed. I don't see a reason why I am, so why should I explain that to someone who is much more depressed than I am? By the time I turned 14 I can say I was depressed. ""Functionally depressed"" I guess, using terminology from one of the top posts here. I don't know what to do.",reddit_train.csv

Post: Friends making ammends I previously wrote about this. A friend and I got into a fight where I said I don't know if I can be friends because a situation occurred where I was hurt and many different events kept piling up. I knew I felt very depressed with that friendship though she never really did something bad like other people post on here. It was more like she did something I was not okay with and she never really reached out to me ( months). She was my best friend and someone I love and care about. I know I made my mistakes as well. She texted me to reach out and I talked to normally to her didn't get angry/say anything angry... just small talk... Can we ever be close friends again and how?

"Post: Having to share a small living space with Grandpa My grandpa and I are having trouble adjusting to our new living situation, and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas to help us in this predicament. Backstory: I never really saw eye to eye with him while growing up. He was quite the wild prankster, and his antics often left me humiliated and embarrassed. Back in my boyhood of 1991, he pantsed me while I performed at the school talent show. He routinely mentions this while at family gatherings, and it has subsequently caused me extreme grief. This trend of surprise humiliation lasted for two decades. Just when I thought me and gramps were cool again, I'd feel my pants hit the ground. He's deprived me of my sanity, as well as given me an extreme fear of public speaking scenarios. I ended up forcing him to go to family counseling with me, and he denied the whole thing. After turning in historical footage (my mom always cam-corded my recitals or graduation ceremonies), he finally gave in and admitted to his rude behavior. It took a couple dozen sessions, ending with a mock-talent-show, where I played my trumpet for the therapist. Gramps just sat there, cool as ice. With arms folded, he nodded to me - and that's where things changed. Anyhow, I had an extra ticket to go see Teagan and Sara - so I got ol' gramps on the phone. He kinda razzed me for listening to such feminine sounding music, but eventually accepted my invitation. I picked him up and brought him to the venue. The ticket office said there was a mixup, and that we'd get front-row seats. This was my lucky day, as well as a great way to finally bond with the old codger. It took a couple of songs, but he really got into it. He was so exuberant, jumping up and down on his seat. He pulled me up, and I did the same. After the first half of the set wrapped up, the sisters on stage looked down at gramps and I. They asked us if we were having a good time, and also the nature of our relation. A stage hand passed down a microphone to gramps. ""I'm here with my grandson!"" There was this big 'awwww' that came from the crowd. They asked us how long he'd been a fan, and he mentioned the fact that I would sometimes play their songs on my trumpet. To my amazement, they pulled me and gramps on stage for the next song. They got me a trumpet and instructed me to play a solo to ""I was a fool"" - It was literally one of the best moments of my life. I was on stage with my favorite sister duet band. Right as I put the brass mouthpiece to my lips, I felt those wrinkly little fingers jutting into my belt loops. I tried to stop him, but my pants hit the ground before I could react. I wanted to die in that moment. Security ended up escorting us out of the venue, where a police officer was waiting for us. Now we're both cell mates for the next year. We got caught in some type of legal double-whammy. He, being the pantser, was ruled guilty for sexual assault. Me, the pants-ee, was convicted of exposure and indecency. Both of us will have to register as sex offenders once we're out of the clink. Anyhow - I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how we could pass the time together? Any board games or things like that? We have a whole year of time to kill, and it really took being cellmates for me to understand exactly how generation gapped we are. Anyhow, your advice is greatly appreciated. I gotta hide this phone, but I'll check for your replies later tonight. Thanks!",reddit_train.csv

Since my dad died I've been honest to her about my limits towards me seeing his corps the day before burial and I've been crystal clear that this Saturday I didn't feel ready yet to go to the cemetery and I assured her that I'll surely go one day.

I’ve been on Zoloft which made me feel like a numb zombie and bupropion which I didn’t feel was working. I’ve also tried Xanax (made me calmer but high) and a mood stabilizer that didn’t really help. I’ve since gotten off medication by my own choice but the problems are coming back. Generally I don’t like rx drugs and would rather do it naturally but it’s not going away.

"Post: Consistent problems with friends distancing themselves Really sorry in advance of how long this is! So some background on me: I’m a 23 year old female. Had a pretty typical life growing up. Had a really stereotypical family - mom, dad, sister, and me. Had good friends growing up, moved schools as a kid only once, and had stuff I was passionate about. During my sophomore year of high school though, my parents got divorced, and shortly after, I had some events happen in my life that sent me into a deep depression. I became suicidal. Now mind you, up through this point, I have had a close knit group of about 8 of us. One girl and I had been friends for almost 7 years and generally I got along with pretty much anyone. Then this guy I knew from performing arts stuff and I ended up going into a relationship. He was 4 years older than me, meaning he was in college when we started dating, I had barely turned 16 and never had been in a serious relationship, he was charming and wanted me to “not be so naive” and - if you can’t already see the warning signs - this became an extremely abusive relationship, in pretty much every way possible starting with emotional abusive, escalating to physical abuse, and eventually sexual abuse. It completely destroyed me as a person. He forced me to end friendships with anyone who tried to help get away from him, which ended up being all of my friends. Eventually, my college roommate helped me escape from him and helped me to get a restraining order during my Freshman year of college. Thankfully, I’m in a really wonderful relationship with someone incredibly kind and supportive and have been for nearly 5 years. But with the exception of my boyfriend now, I haven’t been able to connect with people like I used to before that abusive relationship. Some friends I had back then, friends I loved dearly, never forgave me for ending the friendship, despite the fact I never wanted to. And it still really hurts. I mostly have had off and on friendships through recent years. Mostly the story is: I start talking to a potential friend, we quickly find a bunch of similarities and similar humor, become close really quickly, they become avoidant/ distant/ flakey (or in a recent case - manipulative) and I get upset and end the friendship. I’m quick to forgive and a HUGE pushover, and people really take advantage of this and at some point, I realize this and that’s when I get upset. The other story is that I start to slowly build friendships, like with people at work, and I think things are going well and I come to realize they don’t really care to be anything more than work friends or they don’t like me as much as I thought they did. I currently have 2 friends that I really care about. One of them lives really far and I only get to see occasionally. The other has started to use the busy excuse with me, but then she plasters her hanging out with everyone but me on social media, but the goes on about how she misses me so much and wishes we could hang out. She literally only lives 20 minutes away and she either flakes or lies about being busy working. It’s starting to really bring me down and I feel really down about it since I feel like it’s something that ultimately ends up happening no matter how hard I try or how good of friends we are. To sum everything up, I feel like I’m at a loss and I have a hard time connecting with anyone. I feel like people go out of their way to distance themselves from me when I want to actually do ~friend stuff~ like hang out. I feel like I’m missing something.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Communicating is hard I'm turning 19 this year and I want to move out of my family's house in September. Mostly for my studies, but also because I simply want to move out. I already tried last year but they found a housing for young girls managed by nuns, so I lived here for a while, but I felt uneasy the whole time. I'm heavily depressed and I had to drop out of school this year. My parents told me to come back home so that I could recover, which I did, but they don't approve of me going anywhere else to do so. For example, I feel really good in my boyfriend's family (he doesn't live with them anymore but I'm still very close to them) and wish to spend more time there, but my parents don't like the idea of not being able to give me the kind of comfort I need and find over there, so they'd rather have me stay home. I have spent as little time as possible in my parents' house recently, using every opportunity to get away, and it is understandable they don't like it. But I have always been a solitary kid, and now with my depression it became worse. I don't connect with my parents or any of my 4 siblings, and spending time with them feels like a chore. Communicating within the family is quite rough. And whenever I do try to explain how I feel, it becomes overwhelmingly clear that I'm in the wrong. It feels like whatever I say about feeling bad within the family is deflected by stating my parents and siblings' good intents. I'm sure they do mean well, but I now doubt even my own reasons for wanting anything but staying with them. I can't identify the reason why I don't feel easy with them, because they're all trying their best to help me through those tough times. I feel like an ungrateful brat. I'm not really confrontational either. I usually obey and agree to avoid stirring conflict, but this is getting tiring. If any of you has been in a similar situation, how can you open the dialogue? How can I tell my parents I don't feel good spending much time with them? In my family, direct family should come before everything. I also don't know how to talk about moving out and have a studio instead of being placed in a student housing, especially since my big sister (25) still lives at home despite having a job. It's not a matter of money either. I come from a middle class family and the housing my parent chose for me this year is much more expensive than a studio.

He became more and more distant, he got friends, most of them were verbally abusing me, you would think he would defend me, but he backed up his friends, than his own blood, me growing up, I was (and still to this day) an introvert, and I never kept a close friend, because they would either stop talking to me, or they would say that they don't like me and for the 3 years that I have known his friends, they eventually got used to me, and we played online frequently, and 2 months ago, they disapproved of me getting a GTA Shark Card (in game currency) then they insult me saying I need to grow up, and mature, basically telling me how to run my life, and I tried to stand up for myself, but they still kept saying it Its my life, if I want to act silly, then I will, but the main focus is my cousin, and how he was brutally honest, you know how we hype up our friend to make them feel good about himself/herself? That's not what he did, every time we play online with one of his friends, he would agree and add insult to injury when his friend makes fun of me, in games... He would tell everyone to go after me, in CoD, he would tell everyone to go to his lobby because he's the ""leader"" but the sole reason I'm making this post, was the fact that he did one of, if not, the RUDEST thing ever, here's how it went it was my sister's birthday, I was texting, and he said that he's coming to the party, and I'm pretty happy, a smile stretches around my face, I say ""OK cool, :)"" an hour passes by, and he nonchalantly says, ""welp sorry I can't come, oh well"" and I ask why? And he says I don't know, now usually, most would tell the reason why can't come, or if they don't they make up something, but he all of a sudden says, I can't come I want you keep in mind that, the last time I was in his house, was 4 years ago, and he has only came over for my birthdays or sometime in the fall, so he RARELY comes to my house, and I'm not even allowed back at his house, because of personal reasons but anyway, he couldn't come to my house, but has time to go to his friends house WHENEVER he wants... Gee? I wonder why? -_- he did what no other friend should have done, and hurt my feelings all in one fell swoop.

"Post: Depressed? Or Just in a Bad Rut? (Long Post) I've never really felt like I've had depression before. I'm turning 24 at the end of the week, and this is the first time I've honestly wondered about myself. Usually, I'm pretty happy about things, and my outlook on life has always been realistically positive. But, lately, I just feel absolutely lost. And this morning, after I got off of work, I sat and cried. I'm not much of crier at all, and the only other time I've cried in the last ten years has been at an uncle's funeral recently. This past summer, for me, was a pretty great time. I was in a relationship with a girl who really made me happy, more than any other one had before. I seemed to be having fun every weekend, whether with her or with some friends of mine or family. I had a lot on the horizon, and a lot to look forward to. I was getting ready to finish up my degree, and it seemed like things were going in the right direction. The only thing that was a problem then was that my job was a third shift job, but it was 3 days a week, and usually 11-13 hour shifts, meaning I had time to do stuff outside of it. But, my then girlfriend and another friend had solid connections that they thought could help me land a much better job where they worked, which would carry me pretty well until I finished school. Things were looking up for me. I was pretty happy. I guess things started to slip for me when my uncle got hit with a terminal diagnosis in August. At 47, and with young children, nobody in the family was prepared to lose him. And the disease, an incredibly rare degenerative brain disease, was the same one that killed my grandmother 11 years ago. We lost him in early September. The thing with this disease that nobody in the family is talking about is that, if it hits twice within the same bloodline, there's a 50% chance that living relatives within the bloodline will get it in their 40's or 50's. There's nine of us left in the immediate family, including my mother, my brother and myself. And since it's so rare, there is absolutely no treatment plan. That, for me, was a lot to process. I'm not worried about myself, but the idea that I could still be losing relatives to this disease for years sucks. It's hard enough seeing it happen twice. During this time, things started to fall apart with me and my then-girlfriend as well. I kind of hid out with her for a while, because my family was perpetually sad and in a state of distress. And since I worked nights, I was kind of isolated. Things started to hit a rut between me and her when she started her own treatment for depression. I tried to be supportive of her, while doing whatever anyone in my family needed while my uncle was sick. She really seemed happy that I was there for her, (and things really worked out since she lived so close to my uncle anyways, and I could bounce back and forth from place to place on my days off.) Both my family and my girlfriend were very important to me, and I guess helping them out made me feel good about myself, even though the situation was shitty. I kind of let school fall to the back-burner though. And I kind of neglected my other friends for a while as well. But between work, my family, and her, I was consistently busy. My uncle passed in early September, sending most of my family into a pretty bad state, and only a week later, my girlfriend decided she was done with me, because she was afraid that if she recovered from her depression with me around, then she'd equate me with happiness, and if I left her then she wouldn't be able to recover. (Which ended up being mostly a made up way of saying, I don't love you anymore, but I don't have the courage to tell you.) Obviously, it wasn't fair to her to be stuck with me if she wasn't happy with me, but there were so many better opportunities for her to break things off, and she chose the one that was the most tedious and mentally draining for me. My state of mind after it ended wasn't great at all, and I said some very mean things to her after it ended, (I guess, at the time, I thought it was constructive criticism, but it was all just mean and awful and embarrassing.) Understandably, she hasn't talked to me since, and I feel like I burned any bridge towards reconciling with her. I missed my uncle a lot, but doing favors for his wife and kids helped me at least feel like I was contributing. My mother's still kind of a mess about it, but she has my father for support. My brother had a hard time for a while too, but his job keeps him well occupied. But, lately, for me, the things I can help with anymore have been fewer and fewer. Right now, I just want to fast forward to like March or April. I don't want to deal with my birthday, since the plans I had with my ex-girlfriend are obviously not happening anymore, most of my friends are busy with work and school, and my family is still not back to being normal. Nobody seems to want to do much for my birthday anyways, which is, for lack of a better word, normal for me. When I got home from work this morning, I cried thinking about it all.

None of them are getting the emotional support they need. His wife doesn't regularly see her therapist, she stays out all night several times a week with her new boyfriend, the 18 year old has suicidal thoughts, the 14 year old just feels hated by mom and, along with the 10 year old, is not getting therapy. The 18 year old is getting therapy but she's hardcore into her new religious affiliation, hating mom and can't wait to leave for college I've talked to the wife several times and shared my thoughts about what's going on, she's receptive when I when I speak to her, but it's apparent after this amount of time that she has no real intention of going through with getting the kids counseling and getting into family therapy, staying home more, spending more time with the kids, less time with the husband, etc. Does anyone have any idea how I can help?

"Post: I feel trapped in a life I don't want to live. It took a lot of time for me to consider posting here but I'm gonna be alone for the whole day and can't deal with it. So, hi, I'm just your typical British kid dealing with the stresses of College but the problem is that I'm not stressed because of college (I don't really care much for it but it's better then work), I'm stressed because of this constant cycle of: wake up, spend an hour trying to get up, be 20 minutes late to everything every day, eat, browse the Internet and sleep. All around me there's people who have clear career paths and know what they're passionate about, but I look at myself and realise that I don't have that. I have no interest in working in a job for the next 45 years of my life because there's nothing that I'd like doing. I'm doing fine in all of my classes (As in History and Cs in Maths, Distinctions in BTEC Engineering, everything just feels too simple) but I just still get these weeks where I feel worthless and pointless. I get brain fog, I end up teary eyed and can't talk to anybody for fear of looking stupid (I have speech problems). But then when I end up actually talking to others I apparently look happy. I have spoken to people at my school about it, but it's the same thing every time. 'Oh you're struggling? We'll have a five minute conversation about your feelings and wait months to make sure you're not still sad'. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I stopped taking medication in July 2017 and haven't seen a doctor or therapist since. They didn't help, the medication I was on turned me into a god damn zombie and my therapist got exceptionally pissy at me for not telling the truth about my lack of improvement. I felt like I had to lie so I didn't waste their time and mine, I worry that's why I end up wearing a mask 90% of the time. Even around my family, who believe more in self-help then actually getting an actually decent therapist to try and help me. I'm ashamed to talk to them about it, no matter what anyone says, trust me when I say that they will NOT understand. I have been incredibly clear about it all and got mocked for it, some people just don't want to learn. I had a pretty bad childhood that I try to justify my problems with (dealt with a lot of sexual abuse and my mother died in 2013) but when I'm having these 'days' I'm not thinking about anything in particular that would make me flighty. I ended up admitting a lot of my past to one teacher last week who I admire greatly and whom pretty much just saved my life and I am still cringing today. I know I have no reason to cringe either, I just get so nervous of social interaction. I just don't get why the universe picked me to be its miserable little experiment. I never asked for anything bad to happen, I never asked to constantly feel tired and under the weather, I know that life isn't gonna be perfect but why is it that day after dull ass day I have to feel worse and worse? I try to take responsibility for my health, I feel like dirt, I have other people have some part in it and they take it for granted and hardly any of them actually make a big effort on me. Sorry if my words are jumbled and rambled, I just needed a place to vent whilst I still can.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: What would you do? What do you do when your depressions effects you so much to the point you don't eat or you over eat, you don't sleep or you over sleep, you don't talk to anyone or pretend to want to be around people. What do you do when your depression doesn't allow you to be motivated and takes away all the enjoyment from your life that makes you happy, removing music, dancing and laughing in replace for dark rooms, teary eyes, and silence. What do you do when you won't answer your phone being that only the bill collector is calling, cause you're not able to pay the credit thats pilling up that helps you survive, being that you can't work or can't make money cause of no interest too cause of lack of motivation, cause the thoughts running through your head being that you can't talk to anyone, or that you won't, or that you're disappointed, or that you feel like a burden. Now your phones off and there's no call but the collector is there, no text this shit isn't fair, so what's next? Social media?

When I'm out with them or rehearsing with my band I feel okay.

I feel strong and motivated. And then I have to go home. I am no longer in the company of people who love me, so I start feeling anxious. I start believing they actually fucking hate me. I lose it.

"Post: girl So in the past 2-3 months i been talking to this one girl. I love everything about her and we really clicked together, seeing as we're both socially retarded. Literally everything's been looking up, i started working out, being generally happier and more carefree even in social environments. I'm not exactly depressed, just don't really feel much emotion and I don't relate to people around me. Never been a fan of going out and I've had major problems getting to know anyone (I only have 1 very close friend, besides her). I've always had the feeling that I'm tolerated but not wanted whenever I'm around others, but this chick changed that completely. I actually started to look forward to waking up in the morning and meeting her at uni. On a side note we also like pretty much the same things - similiar music taste, similiar views, similiar feeling of being a reject and ofc vidya games, books and other shit. I knew I was steadily falling in love with her (something I honestly thought impossible before) and just recently I found out she's got a boyfriend. I proceeded to spend the next 2 hours crying like a little bitch for the first time in over a decade. After that I couldn't even hit any fucking awp shots in cs cause I still had tears streaming from my eyes. My question is, have I reached the point of being pathetic enough that I should call it quits and neck myself?",reddit_train.csv

We work together and she liked me alot but since im a manager and shes an employee, we had to keep it a secret but people were already starting to spread rumors about us and my GM who wasntnearly as suspicious about it cut her hours and days for this week and i asked why. His response was that she was flirting with alot of other guys and it was becoming a problem so he cut her days to just 1 this week. When she saw the schedule she thought about us and how it was a bad idea to date and it wouldnt be a good idea anymore since she doesnt want to lose her job. Exactly one week of dating and I already lost someone that i didnt want to go away just like that. Like yeah im a bit sad but not enough to cry or anything but it just like, i was so fucken happy again i started to smile, something i havent done in months and it just felt nice but now im back to my depressed state of being lonely as usual and just play games, work and goto sleep and repeat that day after day until i end it all. This is why i try my best not to date or get attached to anyone because if i try to date, it will just end badly for me. I just want to be happy and have someone close.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I have a close friend who is problematic, but not towards me A couple of years ago, I had a falling out with one of my friends and during this time, I fell back on this girl in my class, who I will call Blue. We got close in only a few months, and eventually, this will be the only time we will ever be in the same class. It was just the two of us. I'm in one of her classes now and my friends still associate me as her best or one of her closest friends. It's not a particularly good association (doesn't reflect on me though, just her). A lot of people don't like her, especially the people I'm friends with now. I haven't been around for a while (I moved down to Brighton for a bit of time) and I haven't seen her either, but I know that she doesn't have a lot of friends. I've been hearing stories and past anecdotes about her that really troubled me, so I'd like to have some advice. This one girl (who would never lie about something like this because she's so sweet, probably still hasn't gone through puberty) said that Blue once pit her up against the teachers and made her cry because she was so stressed and she didn't understand the situation. Blue has a kind of controlling personality and will not be open-minded to other people's ideas and input. An idea of close friend of my close friend, Yellow, was swept by as Blue simply dismissed it, and just wrote what she wanted to do in a group project. Yellow is also quiet, VERY passive and formerly a good friend of Blue and to some point, even I, so when I heard this happening to Yellow, I was really shocked that Blue could even do something like that. She will also guilt-trip you and self-deprecate herself. She will tell you that everyone hates her and that she's really bad at a subject she does really well in. It's annoying, and sometimes I even hear it, but to others she does it in this really soft, guilt-tripping voice. It's a problem because often, she's the problem and then she guilt-trips to turn it to look like she's saying that the people calling her out are just trying to make her feel bad. But Blue has never done any of this to me. When I'm around her, we talk about our futures and Star Wars. She jokes and memes a lot, but because we're not as close anymore, they aren't as funny. I avoid confrontation too so I almost never rebutt her points. Recently, she apologized to me about how poor her behaviour was back then, but I didn't understand what she was talking about. Now, I get it. But her behaviour wasn't just 'back then' either, it was also just a couple (maybe about two) years ago. Maybe even now, but everyone has probably already distanced themselves from her. She also has this fake 'caring' voice that she uses around the people in her music group. She never uses this voice around me, but the music people all generally speak like that. The thing is, the 'caring' side to her is just like a mask, and the people who know her know that she's not usually like that. She has hurt their friends who don't deserve to be hurt, and for no apparent reason either. I know that most of my friends feel uncomfortable bringing her up around me because it'll be something negative (I've never heard anyone who really knows her say something positive about her), but because of that I've been sheltered to how she treats her classmates. Another girl (Red) once said that while she was consoling a friend who didn't like to be touched, Blue came in, wrapped her arms around the sobbing girl and 'glared' at Red like one of those mean girls. Never have I ever heard something so cliched and dramatised, but unfortunately, I could definitely picture it. When I'm around her, I definitely don't feel like her personality is weighing down on me, but I'm conscious of the connotations surrounding her. All the girls mentioned are also my friendly mutuals, so they don't associate me with her, as I'm generally polite, quiet and will crack a joke around them. I also know that Blue doesn't like people so when we were walking from our class, I'm worried that we'll bump into someone that doesn't like her or whom she doesn't like. So yes, I am very bothered about how people view her, mostly because there actually is something to dislike. What should I do? Slowly back out of this friendship? Should I slowly doorslam her until the end of the year when our class is over? Should I just continue being her friend despite her bad behaviours? Two things: the stories are most definitely true, and I don't want Blue to know that I know about her being a bad classmate. I overheard these stories from reliable people. Sorry for the long post. Please help.",reddit_train.csv
Post: My SO has panic disorder and it’s making me depressed. My SO has been diagnosed for now with panic disorder (waiting on health monitor results to check to see if it’s not something else) The last couple of months have been really hard. He has overtime gotten more worried about his health and every time is convinced that it’s cancer or something else deadly. He can spend hours on google about a discomfort he feels and freaks out because webmd says it one thing and another site says something else. He checks his heart rate every 15 minutes because he downloaded an app on his phone. I have taken him to the er multiple times in the past couple of months and each time they say that’s nothing is wrong he’s just having bad panic attacks. He won’t believe them because then he’ll go on reddit and see stories of people being misdiagnosed. I’m convinced he’s a hypochondriac. We can’t go about one day without him saying he doesn’t feel good. It’s hard to enjoy myself whenever we go out because I’m just waiting for him to say something about not feeling good so we can just leave wherever we’re at. I don’t know how to fully support him through this. When he freaks out and wants to call the ambulance I don’t know if I should let him knowing that they’re just gonna say he’s fine or tell him that it’s in his head and make him feel like I’m not taking him seriously. I feel bad for feeling this way. But it’s making me depressed. I don’t know how to go about this.,reddit_train.csv
"Post: Advice To preface this, I wanna say that I feel pathetic/incompetent/exhausted. Female, 30, currently staying at a hotel because I had to leave the house I was living in because of a conflict that recently happened. I got into a verbal argument with my sister (34) that resulted into a physical altercation. She screamed ""Go kill yourself"" and then shoved me and scratched me. My father was a witness to this. I then called the cops because i felt unsafe, she got so angry and turned a bit violent. (This is the third time she's told me to go kill myself and my parents haven't told her anything). Right before the cops came she was arguing with my dad and told me to ""Shut the f*** up! The cops arrived I told one of the cops my side of the story and she told hers. She said that I attacked her and that there were scratch marks on both her arms. I told the cops how could that be when none of the nails on my right hand are very short (I swear to you I couldn't have scratched seeing since I had no nails on one hand. The nails on my right hand are VERY short because they all broke due to cleaning the kitchen cabinets etc). The cops didn't believe me. My sister also claimed that I'm ""bipolar"" which I'm not. So the cops believed my sister and took me away on a 5150. I was released 3 hours later because the case manager said I didn't have any mental health issues. The funny thing is that I told my parents that I wanted permission to use their car to leave that house because I couldn't handle the stress that came with living with her. I would eventually return the car once I moved, got myself established etc. The stress has caused me to lose 3 pounds this week alone. After returning from the behavior health services, I gathered my bag and one suitcase and left. Currently, I'm staying at a hotel. What hurts most of all is that my parents have never told my sister to stop telling me to kill myself. It's as if thy don't care. This is such a shitty experience that I wouldn't wish upon anyone. I'm a hotel with no car, no friends, no home. Is it bad that to think that I just wanted my parents to tell her to stop telling me to kill myself. I feel like I'm asking for a lot.

"Post: Need advice on a friendship! Need advice on a friendship!So I’ve written on here a few times about this crush I had on this straight guy I worked with at work for a little over 6 months or so. To summarize it, in those short months or so we became friends I guess u can say. We both are a year apart, he likes sports, music, and video games, etc. Anyways I developed a crush on him and I couldn’t handle the fact it would never happen, so I said to myself to try and make this friendship something memorable. We hung out 3 times outside of work, the third time was kind of quick but it was still outside of work and it happened last Friday, which I loved not only was I trying to catch up with him since we hadn’t hung out since December and it’s already March. So to put in perspective, I know it’s long but bear with me, it seems like our friendship is awkward at time, there’s long silences in between, don’t really have much to say. I mean for me it’s hard already hard enough for me to engage in a long convo, I’m sort of shy but I’m trying to break out of it, and don’t really have much to say, it sucks because I feel like I’m ruining a friendship that could be great. He kind of has the same personality when I’m with him. I don’t really have many friends well because they’ve all have been assholes to me, so I really don’t have many people to talk to when I want to. So what do u guys of my friendship with this guy? Is it me or do u think it’s complicacted? Just another one I don’t I ever receive text messages from him saying what’s up or checking up on me.

"Post: What's wrong with my dad and what should I do about him? (sorry for the long post) I wasn't sure where to post this, so I just put it under r/family. A bit of background info: My parents have been divorced since I was 4. For as long as I can remember, my dad's been threatening the things I like to keep me in line. When I was 5 or 6, I had a pet bird that he often threatened to kill or release into the wild if I didn't play the piano. These days, he threatens to sell my phone and my computer (which he knows I need for homework) when I don't attend swim practice at a club I've been going to for years. He's also tried to use me to threaten my mom by refusing to pay for my braces (which cost about $5000) because her arthritis has been preventing her from taking me to swim practice. Not to mention she's unemployed. He's also said some pretty hurtful things about both of us when he's gotten mad. He called me egotistic and has told me a couple of times that he no longer looks forward to picking me up from my mom's house, and he's called my mom negative and accused her of not putting in the effort to give me a good childhood. He often tries to guilt-trip me when I piss him off, usually by telling me about how much effort he puts into raising me and how he does everything while I waste my time on my computer. There was a point back in 6th and 7th grade when he was pretty much a textbook case of emotional abuse, but he's improved since then and it gave me hope that he'd stop the threats and angry rants. Also, he rarely goes through with his threats, although that doesn't make them any less hurtful. Besides the threats and somewhat frequent outbursts, he's a generally normal parent. I can get my mom to file for a full transfer of custody, but I'm afraid she can't handle the financial burden of having me full-time. I'm also a little suspicious of her because I remember her hitting me before my parents divorced, even though she denies it. However, she's a much better parent than my dad right now.

"Post: I don't feel well. Hey, I'm a highschool freshman and this has been the lowest I've ever been from the past three years of feeling like I should be gone. Buckle up your seatbelts because this'll probably be pretty long. Since the beginning of this year, I've been wanting to die; I feel so lonely and as if nobody actually cares about me. So, there's my primary friendship group; the people I hang out with the most. All of my (2) ""genuine"" female friends pretty much don't give two shits about me because I tend to act really clingy to them and other people because I've been friends with them since first grade and don't want to lose them. One of my female friends is kinda popular and she barely talks to me, and I just feel like I'm undeserving of her time or something; she's also kinda claimed my other female friend, so I don't get as much time to hang out with them as I used to. My guy friends are also a bit popular and they also happen to be dating my two female friends lol. They do make me feel happy talking to them, and I do hang out with them a lot, but sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be hanging out with them all that much because then I'm ""stealing"" them from my friends. I also get pretty bummed not being in a relationship when my other friends are, and I do feel like I'm not needed amongst any of my friends. (Basically, I just feel like the rebound when one of my friends aren't there). Can we actually talk about one of my female friends a bit more, actually? We'll call her M and my other female friend B. We met M last year and we invited her to hang out with us during our lunches. M was going through a tough time and we helped her out all the time and it was great making a new really close friend. She was really fun to talk to, but I don't know...sometimes she says some shit to me that makes me kinda bummed. I remember telling her how I felt kinda depressed once, and she said something along the lines of ""Stop asking for attention and actually do something"". Another time, I was hanging out with B's boyfriend, but the next day, M was mad at me and told me I shouldn't take him from B (which I do get and feel bad for, but B is totally cool with it and understands how me and her boyfriend hang out :p) Recently, (I don't remember what initiated the conversation really) M and I were talking (which rarely happens anymore), and she was talking about how she feels like she doesn't have anyone that actually cares for her, when she has so many people that clearly do care about her and love her. Then she proceeds to tell me to actually go and make friends again. I hate being petty and talking about other people, but I just don't feel comfortable being very close to her anymore and I'm not sure she's interested in talking to me either. So then that leaves like two male friends, and again because they're in relationships with B and M, I'm trying to pace myself with hanging out with them so one of them don't get upset. It's also pretty hard to make friends in a school where most people are white and really attractive, or already have their place. I'm a non-attractive Asian female that tends to make weird jokes and seem really masculine with the way that I mainly put forward, and I just don't fit in anywhere. I have a lot of anxiety of what people think of me, so then I sometimes struggle with talking to people. I wouldn't say people dislike me at all, it's just that nobody would hang out with me outside of school and it's hard to find people that are willing to spend time with me. There's also the problem with others' expectations of me;; Almost all my life, I've been deemed ""smart"", which has caused so much pressure and anxiety throughout the years. My parents really want me to do well in school, and peers think I'm so great at everything. I *thought* it would go away after elementary school, but even here, people consider me being so ""smart"" and able to do anything. With currently a ~95 average in my classes, it's extremely difficult to maintain that and I feel like if I do any worse, someone is going to get mad at me. People expect me and think I'm so good, but really I'm just average at literally everything I do. I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. I'm not very good at anything, and I have so many interests, it's hard to pin down something that I *should* do with my time. Nothing really interests me enough to do it for like 25~40 years of my life, and the things I would be interested in have literally no way of making a living off of or is something totally unachievable. I feel like I can't make any difference to anyone in the world, and I'll die not making an impression on anyone or having anyone really care about me in the end. I've been hurting myself since about third grade, mostly from scratching myself with my nails until it leaves a mark for a few days and hitting myself on the back of the head. It's extremely satisfying and I feel like it's a good thing to punish myself for being such a waste. So that's pretty much the gist of it, I guess? Mostly just problems with self worth and having others view me a certain way. There is some other stuff, but nothing that I can really think of at the top",reddit_train.csv
"Post: How are you? I am not okay. I’m in a kind of adverse situation, my thoughts are all over the place and I really don’t know how to break this cycle. Basically what happened was that a few days ago, I sent my best friend a message before school, saying that I wouldn’t attend classes because I wasn’t feeling too well, that I felt like giving up and that, in case I also wouldn’t have been at school the following day, I had probably killed myself. I wasn’t joking. Sometimes I get these sort of “impulses”, most likely caused by me being overwhelmed by my emotions, my thoughts, and as a result of that, it feels as though I lose my common sense, my ability to think rationally. My thought patterns become unpredictable, but so far I’ve managed to not act on them, or else I wouldn’t be writing this right now. Currently they’ve been happening a lot more frequently than usual and that seriously freaks me out because during those times death seems like such a good solution to my problems. So, back to the story. Obviously, my friend got really concerned and encouraged me to come to her place because she’d been staying at home that day. BUT she also contacted my mom, which I didn’t know until hours later, and told her that I wasn’t at school and made a concerning remark, but I don’t know exactly. My mom started to call me like every minute and I started to panic because I thought a teacher had called her, so I didn’t pick up any of her calls. I spent the rest of the day with my friend, but called my mom in the afternoon. She asked my where I was and it sounded like she was crying and I told her that I was at my friends place, but after that she declined the call. That night I slept at my dads place, my mom called him and told him that she didn’t care anymore about what I was doing and that kind of hit me. It was the last thing I wanted to hear in that situation. I just don’t know what to do. I really do feel miserable. My friend is beating herself up because she thinks it’s all her fault and I don’t know, I just feel bad for feeling bad, if you know what I mean. That message was a cry of help in a kind of way and I don’t understand why my mom reacted the way she did. It just makes me think that maybe everyone is really better off without me. I’ve been depressed for nearly five years now, but my mom never really paid attention to it and just marked me down as lazy. I’ve been doing great for a good six months in 2017, but then somebody really important to me, somebody that kept me going, passed away in December and since then everything had taken a turn for the worse. Life has become so hard for me, I’m sleeping the days away because I can’t bear the thoughts, the guilt, because I’m too much of a coward to face reality. I’m trying, I really am, but no matter what I do, this feeling, this feeling that eradicates my will to live, remains.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I know I am depressed but I have no energy to do anything to counter it. I've been searching for a job for 4 months to no avail (I used to have an office job for 4 years before quitting it to take a leap of faith to migrate to another country), and from the second month onward, I've plunged deeper and deeper into depression. Back then in uni days, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and was put on medications. I've been off them since my graduation, because I didn't want to depend on them for the rest of my life and I didn't really have the funds to continue the treatment back then. These days I feel exactly like I am slogging through those low energy periods again. My mind would never shut down at my usual bedtime and at times anxiety would keep me awake until 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning. My biological clock is a total mess, in the morning I would just sleep in and refuse to wake up, even though it's already past noon. I tend to shy away from as much social interaction as possible; I just plainly don't want to meet anyone, it freaks me out and makes me uncomfortable. I even refuse to answer any emails or continue the dreary job searching and job application. I know that I am in a big mess. I disgust myself for my lack of energy and determination to do anything. But then when I'm faced with the colossal task at hand, I'd chicken out, then I'd sleep on it, hoping that everything would somehow sort themselves out, only to find myself wake up in the next morning groggy and lethargic. Nothing has changed, and I'm still deep in depression.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: What's wrong with me? I just want to know what's really wrong with me, should I get help or something...I often think about myself like I'm a negative person. Some people describe me as cold as I don't really have any genuine reactions to anything just pure neutrality some even say I lack empathy. I keep most of my feeling and thought for myself and the only thing that's wierdly funny to me is dark humor and misfortune of others. My attitude on the outside, most of the times, is ""I don't care"", but when I'm alone, then shit goes down, anxiety, depression, dark thoughts you name it. I can go days without seeing anyone or speaking to anyone when I'm in this pit of my own making. But then again, I still have this slight need to socialise after some time. The thing is, some time ago, one of my closest friends asked me, what made me happy, when was the last time I was truly happy? And what worried me, I couldn't think of anything, still after thinking for like an half our, there was nothing. Don't get me wrong, I still laugh and sometimes even smile, but for me positive and happy people seem fake. Anyone in a similar situation? Some advice would be appreciated.",reddit_train.csv
Post: I’m glad none of my close friends know I have reddit If my friends knew how depressed I was and I how serious I am about committing suicide they would probably put me in some inpatient program. That would just make things worse tbh. The only time I feel okay is it work because I feel needed and I’m helping people. Everyday is a constant struggle to stay alive and I hate that there’s still a month and half left until the date I chose. I should probably write my letters soon just Incase I don’t make it. I’m glad for this subreddit and that there’s people who understand my pain.,reddit_train.csv

"Post: I cut off my best friend because she was a flake NOW she wants me back ( Am I wrong for declining?) **TLDR**: I cut off my Best friend of 5 years for being flakey and unreliable this summer. She tries to guilt trip me into taking her back. She bought me a gift while visiting in Korea and wanted to give it to me this Saturday. I said ok at first but sent her a text this morning declining the gift and the offer. I feel guilty. Am I wrong? **Long Story (detailed)**: My friend and I had been friends since high school ( I am now 23 and she is now 21). I ended our friendship this summer after giving her numerous chances over the years. Long story shortish, she would never keep her word when it came to meeting up, she was super inconsistent and only really reached out when it was convenient for her. She would always be ""too busy"", she'd change our plans to hang out with others, or she'd flake out all together and not call or show. We both went to separate colleges in different towns so meeting up was hard and hanging out regularly was pretty difficult. I was always the one who would reach out to see how she was doing and I was always the one to initiate are hang out sessions. We would make plans to meet up a month in advance and the week of our planned day, she would flake out. After a while, I started calling her out and she would beg and cry exclaiming that she would change, but she never did. I would text her and she'd never text back. I called her once after a hard day at school and she rushed me off the phone but whenever she would call me for help and advice I was always there front and center ready to listen. I would ask her to help me out and she bail at the last minute due to scheduling conflict or her failing to think ahead. I once asked her to pick me up from the airport. I asked 3 times if she was sure if she could and she reassured me that she'd be able to. A couple of days before the day that she was supposed to pick me up, she calls me talking in circles only to tell me that she couldn't do it. I was broke and couldn't really afford a lyft. Luckily I was able to reach my dad. Over the summer things got even worse. She turned 21 and I had tried several times to link up and take her out. She bailed both times. The first time she bailed because I guess she forgot that she needed to pick up her aunt from the airport. The second time she made date night plans with her boyfriend. It continued to persist. she was teaching me how to drive but didn't think enough of me to let me know when she was going to cancel. Instead, she ghosted me for a week only to blame it on the fact that she was too busy to text me or call me. In September, I had had it! I deleted her on facebook and i blocked her number. She added me back a week later and then I blocked her. Feeling bad, November I reached out one last time to see if we could talk things through. She said that she missed me and was too sad to talk in person and that she need time to process what happened. I rolled my eyes at the text and said whatever. Toward the end of the month (November 19th to exact) she reaches out to me telling me about how sorry she is how awful of a friend she was. I vented my frustrations and she said apologized and alluded to wanting yet another chance. I said ok and we planned to meet on December 22nd. A few days before December 22nd, she texts me saying that the 22nd didn't work for her. She tried to place the blame on me by saying that I knew that she had job training that day and that I should've picked another day. I went off, She begs, I say whatever. Sometime goes by and we talk again and I explain everything that is on my mind. I tell her that its cool to be busy but its also important to make time for the people in her life. She didn't really respond because I guess it was finals week on her end. I told her that I would always be there for her and I wished her the best of luck. On New Years she texted me telling me that she had been thinking about me and she wished me a Happy New Year. I did the same. A few days later she texts me saying that she bought me a gift in Korea (where she had been visiting) and I said ok? I was a little irritated because I know that it was just another nice-nice sappy guilt trip manipulation ploy. We settled for meeting up on Saturday. however after thinking about it, I texted her today and told her that meeting up isn't a good idea. I told her that while she is a very sweet person and that I appreciated the gift, I do not trust her. I told her that I have since moved on and healed from the situation. I included that if she wanted to speak on the phone on Saturday that we could but outside of that I would not feel comfortable meeting up and hanging out. She texted me back a little short saying ""Oh ok"" and she asked if she could text me later. I said sorry and told her to take care. *Am I wrong? I feel a little guilty for how messy",reddit_train.csv

"Post: I’m losing the girl I’ve been with for 7 years and it’s because of my drug use, really bummed I’ve been with this girl since 9th grade I’m now 23 and I can honestly say I love her with my whole heart. I’ve been abusing drugs of all variety since I was 15, herion, meth, pills, uppers, downers, alcohol, marijuana, research chemicals, it doesn’t matter, but I prefer if it fits into a syringe. I have been to rehab 9 times since I was 15 I’d get sober then relapse sober then relapse sober etc.. I have had legal trouble and been in and out of jail she has been with me through it all, she has always been my better half. No words can explain how blessed I’ve been to have her. This past relapse I was clean for two years before hand and our relationship had never been better we were both happy we both trusted and we both loved no matter what. She helped me get my g.e.d. And she helped me through my grandfathers death (he raised me). I had subtle depression over it I felt like that was normal losing a loved one and all, but I eventually stopped doing the things I was susposed to to maintain my sobriety, I felt like I was cured and no longer needed all the recovery stuff. I was wrong. So one day I decided to take some benzodiazepines and that made me go straight to crystal meth in the time frame of a week I was back shooting meth spending all of my money on it and staying up for days. When on meth I have serious delusions I accused her of cheating on me I actually believed these delusions with my whole heart I felt so betrayed and hurt, I wanted to die. What I feel like really did it was I accused her of cheating on Facebook. Even after multiple people telling me I was wrong I couldn’t believe it, I just KNEW everybody was out to get me especially her, I was very unfair and called her names and called her at all hours of the night, completely out of character of me. After being the good loving boyfriend she knows and loves for two years I suddenly became a monster. I totaled the vehicle I owned and went to jail for possession with intent (Benzodiazepines) possession of marijuana and dui. I sat there for two months (thank god) while I was in there she told me she just couldn’t do this with me anymore and told me she has somebody else in her life, this crushed me. I contemplated suicide while I was in there fought anybody that even remotely rubbed me the wrong way and lost my appetite couldn’t sleep. So I get out and I know that I should just stay away from her because I love her and I don’t want to hinder her pursuing something else, I respected her decision to move on, after all I did publicly humiliate her. So right now I have been sober a month and I feel good in a clear minded healthy way, but I have this hole where she used to be I find myself riding around for hours thinking and crying. I’m very upset that I let this happen, currently I just can’t keep my mind off of her I just want our love and friendship back. I am very depressed and lately I have thought about using again but I would rather kill myself before I do that, I can’t get high anymore I would honestly rather be dead. I’m going to NA meetings, going to church, praying all day, but I can’t seem to ever feel better about losing her no matter what positive things I do. I’d rather be dead then to live without her and I don’t know what else to do.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: OPINIONS PLEASE/SISTER ISSUE I’m a 43 year old single mom of a 21 year old son. I suffer from major depressive disorder, ocd, ptsd and anxiety. I work part time and live with my mother. I’ve had issues since I was a child. So I believe my sister and I can be jealous of each other. Her of me because I’ve had issues and me of her because she’s normal. Our father passed away 4 years ago. Which was a devastating loss for all of us. I have lived and raised my son with my parents for the last 12 years or so. My sister moved away about 12 years ago and got married had two kids got divorced, had another kid and recently got married. She is a busy mother of 3 and working full time. After my dad passed my mother and I decided to move closer to my sister and her family. I admit I have issues and my sister is the type that I feel truly doesn’t “believe” in my issues. She sees me as lazy, crazy, etc. I see her roll her eyes when she thinks I’m being too much. She never asks me to help her out I guess because of my issues. I moved here to be closer to her and I feel abandoned. She has no time for me. We are building a house together, my mom and I have an inlaw suite and my sister and her family have the main house. My mother has given them the money to put a down payment on this home. At times I am pissed especially when she throws in my face that there are certain things that I want in the building of the house that are going to cost extra. She is a hard core bitch at times. She hardly shows any love. Her job has her so tied up that she doesn’t take care of herself, sometimes puts off taking her kids to the dr, she has no time to go out with us. She can’t even take time to respond to any of my texts during the day. She makes fun of me in indirect ways, “I didn’t really mean it” when I have a memory issue (from depression treatments). But when I respond with FU it isn’t quite so funny anymore and she’s done with me. My mom is so torn she hates that we feel this way towards each other. My mom has been there for us both thru thick and thin, financially and emotionally. I just want a sister, someone who’s going to have my back once my mom is gone. I have no one else.

I don't if I'm depressed, an idiot, or just a lazy piece of shit but I'm tired of fighting and I just want to throw in the towel. I know my parents just want the best for me but they can't help me. Even when I'm in class it takes all my mental strength to do the simplest things like take notes. The most frustrating part is that nobody thinks I try to do anything. Everyone treats me like a complete dumbass because I can't do my work. I used to have an amazing memory when I was 5-6 years old but when I started elementary school and now it gets worse and worse every year. Sometimes I'll talk to someone and forget what we're talking about in the middle of the conversation for a second. I can't organize anything and I give up before I even try because I know in my head I won't be able to do it anyways. I couldn't pay attention in class if you payed me to do it.

"Post: I kinda like being depressed after dealing with anxiety As a lot of people, I have both depression and anxiety disorders. Basically a thing happened in July, which caused me to have constant panic attacks and overall brutal anxiety until around October, when I just transitioned into deep depression. It was however a big relief. I was completely empty, I didn't care about anything. It was 100x better to me than fucking anxiety. When I'm depressed, I don't feel 'bad'. I don't feel good either, but I'm fine with that. I don't feel anything, it's kinda relaxing. The downside - when I was in the deepest state of depression I was really close to killing myself and I also threatened to shoot up the school, after which police took me to a mental hospital. I've been here for over 3 months now. I did some really bad things, I acted really bad, but on the inside I felt better. When I'm anxious I don't do mean things to people, but on the inside I'm dying, I feel vulnerable and just want help. I understand that depression is awful and people suffer from it, I see what it does to people on this sub. I just wanted to add my experience, since it's different to everyone else's. Anxiety makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack, like I'm going crazy, I sweat, I shake, it feels literally like torture. Depression is the exact opposite. It's calmness, not giving a shit about anything, basically relaxing. I feel kinda comfortable being depressed. I lie on the bed and look at the ceiling, at the wall, whatever. Like I'm on autopilot. Right now I have both, which just feels fucking weird, I can't even describe that. Sorry if I offended anyone. I know some people prefer to feel something, but I'm fine with being an empty shell. tl;dr - depression &gt; anxiety for me.",reddit_train.csv

For as long as I can remember I have tried so hard to stay alive. There was a point in my life where I gave up. I remember my mom was beating me and I put up my hands to block the belt and I was crying. I remember after one of the times she struck me I started to think “what if I gave up?” And I just shut down. In that moment I stopped putting my hands up, stopped crying, and rolled into a ball while mom kept beating me for a few more minutes. For a few years after that I stopped caring about my appearance. I got so fat and I just kept eating and eating. I stopped caring about my grades and didn’t even try. I would just turn in a blank paper with my name on it. During high school I woke up and started to try again even though it was really hard. Since then I haven’t stopped. I regularly do thing I don’t want to do in an effort to make it by. I get up at 5, I shower every day, I go to the gym, I do my homework, study, etc. Currently, I have been working my butt off to be able to join the military to get away from my parents. My depression is acting up so much, it’s getting really hard to keep trying. I often find myself daydreaming and pondering how good/easy it would feel/be to just stop what I’m doing and give up.

Most people in these communities don’t see depression as an illness, but rather as an excuse for being lazy or unmotivated. There’s almost a macho type mindset that you aren’t supposed to talk about those bad feelings and that shit really sucks. It’s pretty much frowned upon to even consider looking for therapy because it’s “for crazies”. I’ve been chronically depressed for years but I’m finally going to seek professional help Monday.

"Post: my cousin Long story short, I have an 8 year old cousin and I don't like him. I'm 19 going on 20 by the way. My mom babysat him when he was a newborn till when he was about 2. I always felt kind of jealous because my mom completely forgot about my dad and I when she babysat him but I always kind of understood that she wasn't doing it intentionally because kids are so high maintenance at that age. Anyways, fast forward to my teen years and his young kid years and I can't stand the kid. He's such a crybaby even for his age and he doesn't like me for some reason. It started because he was taking toys from my dog and my dog started crying, so I yelled at the kid and he started to cry. I don't think I was being over the top and the kid definitely had to have someone discipline him. My mom loves him a lot and always talks about him but it pisses me off because it seems like she cares about him and his dad more than her own husband and only son. The kid does nothing but play video games on his xbox or my mom's iPad when he stays with us, Which I failed to mention is a very common occurrence.

I've gone through therapy before, stopped for a while, and am now trying to find a new therapist that takes my insurance. Every day is almost total isolation. I go to class. I fantasize about working up the courage to talk to someone or say something in class but never do. I go back to my apartment. My randomly assigned roommates, all several years younger than me, keep to themselves. I am too afraid to talk to them. So I hole up in my small room and play video games or do homework. Day in. Day out. Rinse. Repeat. This has been my life for several years now. I'm incredibly insecure. I have some combination of body dysmorphia and an eating disorder. I'm probably quite good looking but I've never been in a relationship; I'm still a kissless virgin. This eats me alive and makes me afraid to talk to women. Another reason to isolate further. I'm losing touch with reality. I have loving parents but their advice isn't particularly helpful. What I want is a friend, someone to talk to--but the anxiety gets in the way. I can talk to people in a structured setting, like therapy, or online (and easily and freely at that). But it's the act of doing it in the real world, in a natural setting, that is just impossible. I fantasize a lot about killing myself though I don't think I could ever actually carry it out. If someone could just be there for me I'd feel better.

I'm a bit nervous about sharing this story (I'm very shy, even anonymously), so I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read it.

Normally, I would have simply told her that everything was fine, and made some lame excuse like ""I didn't sleep well last night"" or ""I'm just worried about my exam scores"". But this was the first time that anybody had ever reached out to try and help, so I decided to be truthful. I thanked her for offering to listen, and explained that I had never shared this with anybody else, so I might struggle to fully express myself. She was understanding, and told me to take as much time as I needed. I was very careful not to unload everything on her, I basically told her exactly what I said at the start of this post: that I struggle with depression and anxiety, and that it's been getting a lot worse recently. Initially, it seemed like it was going well. She had several follow-up questions, some of which I wasn't entirely comfortable answering. However, for the first time in years I felt a genuine sense of hope, and felt like someone actually cared about me, so I answered them anyway. Eventually, she asked me what was causing all of this. I explained that while there are certainly things that contribute to my depression on a day-to-day basis, at the root of it, there isn't really a reason. It's just who I am, almost as if it's hardwired into my brain. It's hard to explain. Do any of you understand what I'm talking about? Anyway, this is where things took a turn. While I was trying to explain that, she stopped me and said: ""I'm sorry, I can't do this. I offered to help cause I thought you were just having girl problems, or school problems, or something. I didn't realize you were totally emo. We're not in high school anymore. Besides, you're a guy, just toughen up"". That last part stung. I knew that was a common sentiment in our society, but to hear it coming from her, someone I've been friends with since high school, really took me by surprise. I didn't know what to say, so I didn't say anything. I just kind of looked down at my lap. We sat quietly for a moment, until she got up and started gathering her things. As she started to walk away I said: ""I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I wasn't trying to do that."" She looked back at me and said: ""Look, a big reason I'm friends with you is because of your positive attitude. It's infectious, and I love that about you. But if that's really just a mask, then you should probably just keep the mask on if we're going to continue being friends."", and then she left. She texted me a few hours later and said: ""I hope you're able to move past your issues so our friendship can move forward"". I haven't responded, and don't plan to. I cry myself to sleep at night enough as it is without also worrying about maintaining a fake personality for her. I probably won't be opening up to anyone like that again anytime soon (except, of course, to all of you wonderful people on the internet). Deep down, I know that most of the people in my life wouldn't react the way she did. But I just don't think I can build up the motivation to try it, not when I struggle just to get up in the morning. I want to thank you all again. Not just for reading my story, but for being a part of this community. Depression and anxiety really suck, and nobody should have to suffer through them alone. ...I'm gonna go hug my pillow now.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: How can I Kill the negativity inside my head? As I'm on my self improvement journey, even though I'm making progress, I hear a voice in my head telling me horrible thoughts. It's lowkey making me depressed. It says stuff like ""you're so shit,"" ""you're fat so you might as well not even try with women,"" ""your grades are horrible,"" ""your hair isn't cool yet,"" and ""oh so you can dress well now but you're still a shit person overall."" Even when I have an accomplishment like a successful concert or a new track of music, my jerk brain still tells me that I'm shit and not good enough. Maybe I just need to hit the iron harder and keep getting in shape? How can I kill this voice? It's ruining my self esteem and happiness.",reddit_train.csv

Post: My gf is planning on killing herself and idk what to do... Ok so me and her have known each other for 9 months. We are in a long-distance relationship. We have never met in real life. I think she may be bipolar. One night she told me she cut herself a little bit. On her thigh. At first I thought she was joking. She showed me the mark if lefted in the morning and I knew it was serious. She is 16 and I am 18. She has told me before she wants to die. She has had a bad past with men but I won't go into any details. It was just really bad. She doesn't talk to her parents about it just me. Her mother and father may get a divorce so that makes this situation even worse. She can be really happy at times then really down. We get in fights sometimes but they are usually resolved. She always complains she is a bad gf because she treats me like shit. I forgive her for doing so because of her shit life. Today we were just talking casually and a few mins later she said I will kms on said date. Then I told her why would u. She said love u bye. We then went back and forth until I decided to leave her alone. She said she wasn't feeling ok. But I have never heard her give me a date before. Saying you will is one thing but a date means you have planned out how u want to go. I didn't tell my parents the full story and neither has she. She has tried killing herself before. I didn't know her at the time. She doesn't have any friends in real life and the ones she does have just use her. She is also behind in school which stresses her out. I will go into more details if anyone is willing to help me and thank u for hearing me out.,reddit_train.csv
"Post: What’s the point in living? Obviously with the title you would think I’m sad and hate myself or am severely suicidal. In reality, there’s truth to that, but I seriously do not see a point in living. I’ve tried different things to try and discover myself like spending 1500 dollars on camera equipment thinking maybe photography is my calling only to return it the next week. I’ve bought a jeep thinking maybe overlanding or off-roading is my thing and now I’m in the process of selling it. I have 1 friend that I hang out with once a month. I have 2 real life friends that I text occasionally. I haven’t had a girlfriend in several years now. Mind you I turn 20 years old tomorrow. I don’t know what the next step in my life is? Who am I? Is there something more to me than just working then going home just to sleep all day? I’ve had a small problem with taking pain killers like oxy, vicodin, and codeine. I just don’t find any joy in any part of my life. I don’t want to die, but at the same time I wouldn’t mind not waking up tomorrow. I just want a passion. Something to live for. I don’t want to be like this, but I’ve tried different things all my life and I’ve lost all joy. Is there a way to discover myself? Is that even an actual thing? What am I missing in my life? I just want to look forward to living another day rather than dreading it. To clarify, I don’t consider myself suicidal. I don’t WANT to die. I WANT a reason to be alive.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Best friend has a bf and is MIA I want to start a thread for people who have best friends/friends who have been MIA as a possible result from having a bf/gf. Please share your stories and give advice to those who post. So here’s my story: So my best friend of five years has had a boyfriend for over a year now. However, she’s recently been MIA. There has been times where I hadn’t seen her for two weeks or maybe a month, but this time it was a lot more. Despite living a few minutes away from me, I hadn’t seen her in 2 months!! Every time I asked her to hang out she would say that she was busy, but she wouldn’t suggest meeting another time. We barely texted around this time either, I was the one that mostly initiated the conversations. Although she was busy, she was able to meet up with her boyfriend plenty of times who happens to live an hour away from her. She would always post photos of them together in social media and I would honestly feel upset. Eventually, I asked her to hang out again and she said that she had plans to go to the movies that night with someone else(not her bf), but that I could join. So we went to the movies and she dropped me off to my house right after the movie because she had to wake up early the next day. So we didn’t really talk (since it’s the movies) and I couldn’t address how I felt about not seeing her since there was someone else there as well. Also, the only reason I saw her that one time is because I asked her to hang out. If I hadn’t texted her, then she wouldn’t have invited me and I wouldn’t have seen her. After that I didn’t see her for a while either and I wanted to meet with her in person so that I could speak to her. A couple weeks later we finally saw each other. The first thing I told her was how I felt upset because I felt like she wasn’t making much of an effort to even talk to me or see me. I told her that we should see each other more and she agreed. She then caught me off guard by stopping me and saying “I know what you’re going to say.” She claims that she knew and that she had been feeling guilty for the past months. She then said that those months were kind of hectic because her bf was going through something. But that’s it... she didn’t apologize and it just doesn’t sit right with me. All she said was how she felt guilty and then mentioned something about her boyfriend to justify her behavior for the past months. We hung out for a couple of hours, however her bf kept calling her and she’d answer his calls during this time. She’d recently gone on a short vacation and I didn’t know when she’d returned to town until I saw a photo on Instagram of her and her boyfriend together. I’m honestly very mad and I feel as though I can’t say anything because I had already mentioned it. What pisses me off more is when she had just gone on vacation for two days and posted a photo of her boyfriend on social media with the caption “It’s only been 2 days and I miss you sooo much!!” Like are you seriously kidding me, you hadn’t seen your friend in more than two months... I’m honestly so mad and I feel like I can’t tell her without her getting mad. She’ll probably get defensive since it involves her bf and since I mentioned it before. She’s honestly the only best friend I have and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m starting to resent them and I don’t want to. Is there any advice that anyone can give me?",reddit_train.csv

"Post: I'm just waste of sperm Where to start? Well I only life with my mom in shit apartment(my dad was alcoholic ect.) My mom is in debt because of school.. and has been in dept all her life. So all my 17 years we are poor. Sometimes we live without electricity because she can't pay in time. In school when there's a road trip to somewhere I don't go and say I don't want to go because I can't afford. (sometimes I want to go but most of the time I don't because of my mental illness.. ) Sometimes i don't have nothing to eat for dinner . All my 17 years I only eat 2 different food at home..potatoes or pasta. Because we are poor my teeth are really bad of eating all the shit junk food. I just don't smile anymore. Sooo another problem is I'm stupid just plain stupid I had to repeat classes 2 times and now I just don't care anymore because i will probably kill myself. I have low self-esteem. I SOO FCKING BAD HATE MYSELF IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS.

"Post: Why did they forget me? I was never someone people would consider anti-social. Rather, I was the opposite. I loved talking to people, meeting new people, and just being social. In highschool, I never had a ""group"" of friends per se, but I knew almost everyone in my grade, and was friends with a lot of them. After high school, I went to a local university, so I'd have to commute to my school, unlike the rest of my classmates who went to to schools further away. My current university is a huge commuter school, so there's no on campus experience to be had, and I'm actually transferring to a local community college instead, so I can transfer out later. Through all this, the friends I had in high school have all kind of forgotten about me. Even in high school, I'd be the first to message people, or the one to initiate hangouts and whatnots. But now, in college, its the same but so much more lonely. All my friends are away, and I'm rotting here. I feel so alone. On top of this, I miss my ex from a year ago. We went from meeting, to best friends, to huge fallout, to reconciliation, to best friends, to dating, to nothing. I miss the friend part. This loss has dampened my mood for a year now. Just overall, I feel so lonely. A year ago I felt on top of the world, and now, I'm back to shit. All I ever wanted was someone to message me first saying ""Hey dude, how are ya?"" Its been a while"". The worst was Thanksgiving break, where I had excitedly messaged a few people saying I'm so happy to see them and we (read: I asked to) made plans to hangout. A lot of them fell through. Others postponed till Christmas break. I messaged 28 people one day, desperate to talk to someone. I feel like I will never be anyone's ""everything"" ya know? I want a dog. Not just because its cute and all, but I want a companion that will never forget me, and will love me. I hate myself. Depression sucks. Loneliness sucks.

"Post: Was it wrong to block my dad's phone? Was it wrong of me to block my dad? We had a massive fight that just escalated quickly, as we always do. My dad has a habit to threaten to disown me every time he gets angry. Once I pointed out how hurtful it was, and asked him to please not to say that, but nothing changed. So I’m just trying not to respond to these angry text messages about how he wanted me to stop using their address because we are not family anymore. 20 minutes later he sends another message telling me to do as he says or he will embarrass me in an extended family group chat (he doesn’t know that it doesn’t bother me and he eventually carries out this threat later), and then 20 minutes later he offers me a deal where he would drop this address issue if I do a couple of things that he wanted. Sorry for being vague, the things he wanted were the things I essentially didn’t want to do and is linked to what we had an argument about. From my perspective, I saw messages that were intentionally hurtful, about how I wasn’t family, and then I saw a threat to shame me, and then I saw what looks like a way to manipulate or coerce me into doing what he wanted. It was very late at night and I had work the next day. That was the point I blocked his number (and I told him before I blocked it) and it is the first time ever in all 30 years of my life. However, now I’m wondering if it was the right thing to do, because well, Asian parents always say shit like that and don’t mean it, and I think my very drastic step would have upset both my parents a lot. An imposed silence also sabotages the opportunity for future open communication and is quite passive aggressive as well. If they were overreacting about the disowning me part, then I could have angered them to the point where they decide to go through with it. The next two days I unblocked my dad and sent some messages about how I was sorry I had to block my dad and clarified some of the things they were unhappy about (some of what they were unhappy about wasn't at all true). But I think both my parents have now blocked my number. Yet I can't blame them for doing that because I did it to them first, but I do wish I had just turned off my mobile, or been able to bear the burden of hearing shitty talk, instead of blocking my dad. (It's not possible to visit them as we live in different countries). Prior to this fight, I have been working through ‘abandonment’ issues with a therapist. Not hard to understand why… my dad always says things like ‘don’t call me dad’ and ‘don’t come home’, ‘don’t need a daughter like that’ if I don’t do what he says for as long as I can remember. My parents don't know this. I’ve thought about completely cutting my dad out of my life, but I’m undecided as I feel like other people who have done it have more serious issues like abuse, violence, lying, and more about conflicts on serious issues like marriage, religion, sexual identity and child custody. Would really appreciate some 'Asian' perspective here, as most of my friends don't fully understand the cultural aspect of this.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Does anyone else miss the person they used to be? I've always struggled with depression, but sometimes it's more manageable than other times. I've noticed that with every new year and myself getting older, I begin to look back on my past and long for it, even sometimes breaking down because I miss the person I used to be. I'm 23, so still young, but I really wish I could go back and be 19/20 again because that was when I was truly happy. I had moved out of my hometown, had lots of friends, a good relationship, I lost tons of weight and was confident for the first time ever, I traveled and worked for fun instead of working as a means of survival. I loved life, I had so much energy and such a bright outlook on everything and I had a lot of fun. Now, that's all over. I really only have one good friend left from those times and he doesn't even live near me anymore; sometimes I get really down when I think about old friends and start thinking about things I could've said differently that might've prevented the arguments we had that would eventually lead to the end of our friendship, I really never knew how much I needed them until they no longer wanted me in their lives. My relationship fizzled out in the same way and I've yet to develop a connection like that with anyone again. I've also gained all my weight back and can't stand to look at my own reflection. I don't know how to be happy like I was again. I look at old pictures from times past with old friends, destinations I went too and I want to cry because I just wish I could go back. I'm so depressed and hate myself, I'm incredibly lonely and am just a shell of the person I used to be. It's like I'm mourning my past life or something.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: My Mom shot herself. Hi forum, I am going through alot right now and have no idea what to do. I will tell you the story, its a long one.. I hope you are willing to read. I am 32 years old, I was very close to my mother.. We had a bond that was as strong as steel. My dad whom she was with since the age of 15 left her 11 years ago for another woman and found happiness. She had never been with any other man. I have an older sister that is 42 and we had different relationships. My mother was angry and could never get over my dad, year after year we would hear how much she hated him but still loved him, she would wish they could be one again. It never happened, she had been with no one and remained lonley for 11 years. Her depression became her life, it was so bad we would stop talking to her because all she would talk about is killing herself and how she hated my dad. 10 years of it, She had little money and was very sick, She went from healthy to brittle in a matter of 10 years. Back surgery's, aching bones, depression, pain pain and more pain. It became up to me and my sister to take care of her, she couldn't drive so we always had to drive over to take her to the dr, groceries or to get things she needed, it became stressfull and we would somtimes bicker over it..even after the divorce my dad helped when he wanted to or could. She started thinking she was a burden.. then started lashing out on us at times, I went a whole year not speaking to her until she called me to apologize for her horrible words with me. I forgave her and we began a relationship again...this time it was amazing again, we got along and finally after 10 years she accepted my partner. Long story short drama hit the fan again in early Nov this year. Things were said between her and my sister and they got me involved, I got upset with my mom and she was so hurt and thought that I thought she was a liar. My sister told me she said something about my son that she claimed she didn't. I didn't care after a while, I had plans with her on the day before thanksgiving to go see her.. on the 19th of NOV. She asked on the 19th if i could come hook up her VCR so she could watch A Christmas Story, I told her next weekend, then she later that night got upset again, she texted all of us the usual suicide talk. I had told her the day before that I didn't want anymore drama, if i went over with my family I didn't want to hear about my dad and sister. I just wanted to have a good time. She then texted me and a lot of other family that she loved me. that it wasn't my fault, she bought the gun... (I took her to get that gun for protection so I always told her if she did that I would feel to blame) She would say "" SON I bought it! Dont feel to blame"" I hated that! Still I never belived she would do it.. I was so bitter about her not wanting to be possitive I hadent called her. I ignored her suicide text and just decided to let her cool off.. 20th, 21st-29th we hadnt spoken.. I had a bad feeling but didnt know why.. she hadnt called.. so i figured she was angry with me.. I get a call from my aunt on my dads side who she was very close with.. ""Is it true? The rumors about your mom?"" I was picking up my kids from school.. I said ""huh? what she say about me this time hahaha?"" ""Call your sister"" she said.. I called and she told me to go home right away.. Then she said when getting home "" Mom... mom... *cries*... Moms dead.. she killed herself"" I said ""dont say that"" about 12 times breaking down more and more each time I repeated it.. I fell apart crying for who know how long... day one was hard, day two was harder, day 3 was numb and empty and I couldn't cry or sleep, day 4 I then hit a new horrible moment.. I found out she had been in her apartment dead since the 20th.. the complex lied and said no one heard anything and thats another story.. they are being sued soon.. her body was in there so long that we will not have an open casket this week in her funeral.. Then i went into her apartment to start gathering her things.. i smelled the death and decay.. I have never felt so sick and horrified in my life. I will never forget it.. i went to where she did it and saw the carpet cut out and her bed gone.. her place was left just like I last saw it.. it killed me.. I am now on day 6 and her ceremony is tomorrow in her home town.. Idk what to think or feel anymore.. my wife is trying to support me cause her mom died when she was 17 but i am changing.. She can see it, I dont want to run my company, I dont sleep, I have this numb feeling.. I cry out of no where.. I can not stop picturing her lifeless body, I cant stop thinking ""was she in pain?"" picturing her bleed out her exit wound for over a week.. I cry and can not stop.. I feel like dying..

Post: Just cut off all of my friends and I’m feeling alone and regretful Posted this to r/advice but I think that wasn’t the right place for it. I just cut ties with nine people who I considered “family” for almost 10 years. Their negativity and inability to understand what I’m working towards has literally taken a huge toll on myself. ‪Friends are supppsed to support you through the good and the bad but instead I was being anchored and every time I felt I was getting out of it I was pulled back down. ‬The fact that I was so attached to them made this one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do in my life and it took every ounce of myself to finish telling them I didn’t want anything to do with them. They don’t understand that in order for me to become a doctor I have to commit a lot of time to my studies. But if I can’t show up to something such as drinking I get absolutely torn apart by them. It’s like they hate when I’m productive but they enjoy seeing me partake in stupid shit. They’ve told me that I’m a liar and a terrible friend on numerous occasions and it’s just too hard to even reason with them at this point. Did I over react and should I iron things out with them? It’s just since I was so attached to them I don’t know how to deal with this situation. I’ve had so many good times and years with them but lately it’s been so difficult.,reddit_train.csv

I was recently diagnosed with depression after someone called a sub division of the Canadian child services because I was a suicide risk. Right now I'm on vacation in park city, Utah… I'm the first and only one in my family with any sort if nenral problems. I end up freaking out on the inside and my parents just tell me that this is the best part if my life and u should enjoy it. Hesri g that makes me want to kill myself more than the usual amount because I know what torture it is to be alive and if this is the best it gets what is the point. It's currently 12:32 and I'm in the basement after my brother kicked me out of my own bed. I got about 5 mins of sleep before this happened and the part that really pisses me off about it is the fact that I'm an insomniac. It's a miracle I get anything and he just wakes me up. My brother is 10. When he was 8 and 9 he would have tried to drown me multiple times and stab me once. When my diagnosis came around he's been doing everything he can to.push me towards suicide.

"Post: Obesity Is Killing Our Friendship Context - I'm 21 F, my friend is 24 F. Both students living alone. Obesity related health issues don't just run in her family - they've killed almost half her relatives. Six years ago, she ate fine, sure she was ""curvy"" but that was her build, her nature. She went on walks with her friends. Now she can barely make it to her front door. Her cousin - in his teens - died recently from heart failure. Weight related. Yet, she continues to put on weight, eat awful food - like taking home meat double burgers from mc donalds and then re-frying them at home, for breakfast, plus sweets, every day - and also taking energy drinks all day followed by sleeping pills at night. That is, physically, killing her according to her doctors, but there's where our issues as friends start. What's killing out friendship is her desperation - but absolute lack of effort - when it comes to loosing weight. She talks about switching back to eating the things that, when we first met, she loved - banana breakfast smoothies and chicken schnitzel. She even did a Go Fund Me for a stomach reduction surgery. Has seen more nutritionists than I knew existed. Yet whatever happens, she only eats more, or worse. She was told to stop eating pringles, and replace them with a healthy alternative like corn wafers but instead, she swapped them for deep fried pork buns. And so on. Friends have always offered to help, to buddy up, to go with. I've been on diets she ditched the first day. I've been to the gym only to have her ""go bathroom"" out the front door. Everyone else gave up. It doesn't help that her family, Fijian-Indians, seem to see food as the only way to show love. The early years, when she actually tried to diet, they'd constantly bring her fatty treats because they thought she looked too skinny. And of course, she'd eat them. And they'd bring more. I have seen her go through almost four years of pretending she'll try. I've gotten so excited and so happy and so hopeful only to have it thrown in my face. I love her, but in all honesty, I don't want to keep waiting and watching for her to die. Because that's what the diagnosis has been for the past 6 months - change her life, or die from complications. But all she does is whine about being fat, and then ask me to order in pizza. What would you do? I don't want to continue to watch her kill herself, but I can't think of anything I can possibly do to help her change.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I need to get this out. Feel free to ignore it.(Potential Triggers: Domestic and parental abuse, self harm, bullying, substance abuse etc. Avoiding detail AMAP) I am so sick of trying to just survive each day. I want more than anything to go out and live my life. I want a job, an apartment, a pet... but instead I’m stuck living with my grandparents because I’m at the point where my agoraphobia is so bad I can BARELY leave my bed. I don’t think I have felt “happy” for more than 10 minutes at any given time in the last 6 months. I applied to try to get a tattoo to cover some scars I have from when I got really bad, but they never contacted me again...so that reminder is always there making me feel sick and myself and taunting me to do it again just to numb the crap in my head. I’m trying to be a partner to this amazing guy I care a ton about, but I feel so emotionally shut down that I don’t even react to jokes or love anymore. I don’t even like when he cuddles me because his breath on my neck is a trigger... Now, I do not have it as bad as a lot of other people. I grew up in a family with a loving (OCD) grandmother, a grandfather, and a (drug addict) mother who all always made sure I had food and a place to sleep. That alone is more than a lot of people get...but every time I try to talk to someone and they don’t respond to me I flip out at them because my mom didn’t want me to interrupt her high. When something goes SLIGHTLY wrong or is a SMIDGE out of place I panic because that’s all I had around me. When someone on the street spits I flinch because my ex’s favourite way to degrade me was to spit in my face while mocking me. When I go downtown I get anxious because that’s where I was publicly beating by a (different yet no les “charming”) ex. I avoid drinking now because I don’t want to fall into drinking to feel happy again and I definitely don’t want to add to my scars...but this is all I have known my whole life. Every time I try to take a step forward, improve myself, or even leave the house to do something I once enjoyed, it feels like the weight of every circumstance and bad decision in my life is right there to push me further into the dirt. The only ways I know how to make money aren’t things I want to do...the only people in my life I want to be around I can’t stand to be near...I feel like I have nothing left to hold onto and I’m drowning! I’d check into the hospital just to get away, but unless I were to actually make an attempt on my life they wouldn’t accept me (but at least we have free healthcare right?)... I just need a day of normal.....",reddit_train.csv

"Post: My wife wants another baby, I don't. Are we headed for divorce? Hi all, I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this so let me know if it's not. The title pretty much is why I'm here but let me give you some background. My wife and I dated for about a year before she got pregnant. We quickly got married and had our first girl in 2005. In 2008 we had our son, followed by our third, another girl, in 2009. We were crazy busy for a while there and things finally calmed down a few years ago. We made up for that by deciding that we should move to a nicer area. We live in Vancouver where property costs a fortune. To afford that, my wife had to go back to work full time. She had been working 3 days a week. She is a teacher so she still gets the summers, Christmas and spring break at home with the kids. She kind of half joked about having a fourth child before the move but when we moved it was clear that we couldn't afford another baby. Now we've been in our new home for about 1.5 years. The kids have made new friends, settled into their new school and sports teams. Our oldest will be heading to high school next year. Now my wife wants a new baby. She is obsessed with it. It's all she thinks about and all she talks about. She says the kids are getting older and they're not going to need her soon and she's getting depressed about it. Every couple weeks it boils over and we fight or she bursts into tears again. I don't want another baby. Our youngest is 8, our oldest is 12. I don't want to go back there. I've moved on from the baby stage and I love where we're at right now. We are crazy busy with sports and activities most of the year (hockey x2, baseball x3, swimming, art class, etc....). I am happy where we are, I don't feel like anything is missing, there's no hole in my life. If we were to have another baby, we'd have to move again. Change the kids schools again. Have the kids meet new friends again and join new sports teams again. I don't want to do that to them. I've also been carrying the financial burden for the last 12 years as my wife had finally give back to work full time. I'm not saying she wasn't working at home taking care of the kids, she was. I am saying that if we missed a mortgage payment, that was on me and it's stressful and it's nice to have some sort on that department once again. I don't really know what to do, I'm afraid we're headed for a divorce but that's the last thing I want. Should I have a baby so she won't divorce me? What if we're in the same spot eight years from now when the baby starts to grow up a bit. I asked her if she would go speak to a counselor with me but she says it won't change her mind that she wants another baby.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Ashamed of being depressed. I've never been ""diagnosed"" with depression but I think that I'm there. Girlfriend decided she needed ""space"" so that took me down more, found a car I really wanted but after days of number crunching I decided I couldn't afford, my exiting car and house repairs keep racking up. I have few friends and live alone. Honestly I feel bad every day. I get to work an hour late and dread it, for no reason. It's not hard and I generally enjoy it while I'm there. I feel almost certain that I'm depressed, but why? I feel bad about that. I own my own house, my own car, and have no real money problems, yet I feel like shit constantly. My sister is a recovering addict. I've seen how low people can go, yet I'm not even close. I've generally been lucky and have done reasonably well for myself, yet I still feel down. No real life partner to speak of, very few friends. But I feel that being upset and down about it is wrong because so many people have it so much worse. Is that wrong? I dunno.

"Post: I don’t want to continue like this For the past few years, I’ve found it extremely difficult to talk to my mom. Some family drama happened a while back and ever since then she’s been really tense and on edge. Almost every time we have a conversation it turns into a debate, usually ending in me sobbing and her yelling (I’m not trying to paint myself as the victim; I’ve said some nasty things to her as well). I’m afraid to bring up my anxiety/depression, because whenever I have in the past she rants about how therapy and medication doesn’t work, there are plenty of natural remedies, yada yada yada. I just want to not start panicking every time I’m in public! She’ll often blow things way out of preportion to what they actually are. If my tone changes during a conversation, or I let out a heavier breath, she thinks I’m “talking back” or scoffing at something she said and start yelling and threatening me. I feel like it might be paranoia, and it’s getting worse. I basically dread every interaction I have to have with her, but I would really like to have normal mother/daughter conversations, go shopping, have her help me with homework, whatever. Instead of arguing nonstop from morning till night. I just fucking hate it. Am I being dramatic? If not, what can I do to remedy the situation? If so, then it wouldn’t be the first time.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Friends keep making fun of me? Firstly, I'm 18 and attending high school right now.Recently, my parents got us a dog, and we named it Carly. I freaking loved her, but after reviewing some medical expenses we would have to pay, we had to give her back to her shelter after only a month or so of having her. I was heartbroken. I came back to school on Monday this week and told my friends. Now in my friend group of three, there is one guy who loves to make fun of us. One of my friends is fat so he makes fun of his weight. I'm gay and he makes fun of me for being a faggot. My other friend does weed and he makes fun of him for being a drug junkie. But I think he crossed the line this time. He made fun of me by saying ""you killed your dog"" and all he's been doing this week has been calling me a ""dog killer"" and telling everyone that I am one. The annoying part is my best friend in the group is tagging along with this joke and they both think it's okay to make fun of me for this. I'm kind of embarrassed to say this, but I'm a very emotional person and I suffer from depression so it's hard for me to deal with this kind of stuff. Today when they started making fun of me again for being a ""dog killer"" I left and hid in the bathroom cause I just wanted to cry and I did. I hate it when people are mean to each other and it really hurts when someone does it to me. That, and the fact I was really sad about Carly leaving me makes me just not want to talk to them anymore. But the problem is those guys are the only friends I really have (Trust me, they remind me I'd have no friends if they weren't so nice to be my friend). I really don't know what to do. I miss my dog, I've been really depressed as of recently, and my friends are making fun of me. What should I do about my friends, honestly? Because I know if I tell them ""guys stop making fun of me, I didn't kill my dog"" they'd without a doubt say something like ""that's exactly what a dog killer would say!"". I've never been able to reason with them whenever they make fun of me. Can anyone help me?",reddit_train.csv

I’ve been going through a really bad depressive episode and today at school someone said “ remember when you were all ‘sunshiney’ and happy and laughed all the time?

"Post: What ambitions are left to aspire to if you don’t want kids? I’m a 27 male surrounded by mombies and a culture that I don’t fit into. I feel like I’ve accomplished all my very serious ambitions from graduating college to studying in grad school and withdrawing, twice. (I was doing fine in grad school, they were job prep program. School Psych and a teacher prep program. I withdrew basically because I was apathetic about the job goals/mission. I studied philosophy/psychology during my undergrad and I feel extremely content with all the knowledge I’ve accumulated, but it just feels like I’m getting old. It feels like friends are moving away, the world is getting smaller, less wondrous. It’s like realizing I’m too old to aspire to great things like being an astronaut or something. I feel like my role models are way too big, or that things are just downhill from here. So I’m asking myself questions like why bother working? Why bother moving forward? Maybe I’m pessimistic and think the US political situation is horrible and it’s affecting me. But I wonder how older people without kids keep going forward. What pushes them?

"Post: ""I used to be you"" ""It gets better"" ""You have to love yourself first"" &amp; other lies Not even sure if I should post in this sub, but.. To the people who *used to* suffer from depression, from trauma, from anxiety, from whatever made you miserable, I'm not you. You were once miserable, like me, you saw no light at the end of the tunnel, but then, you didn't give up. *Something* happened. Now you're happier, now you've got your happy ending, now you've got people who love you for who you are. But I'm not you. You probably changed, you probably were capable of change, were strong enough to change yourself even. I'm not you. I've been gone for a long time, now. There is nobody here but bad habits and terrible feelings. Sometimes I feel a semblance of someone who just wanted to make other people happy and be loved, but I think the misery just piled on like miles of permafrost. I can't blame people for not loving me, but I do blame them for lying to me. Don't they know it hurts more to say 'I care' when they don't, and it takes me much too long to figure it out? How am I ever supposed to trust people when they say they care if it's been such a common lie? The worst part is, *nobody can prove it, because nobody can help me, because nobody knows how or wants to*, I don't know. I've been asking for help for a long time now but nobody takes me seriously. You, who says that I shouldn't give up. Why? I'm not you. Years from now I will *not* be surrounded by people who love me, I will *not* be anywhere closer to happiness, I will *not* find anyone who loves me. If that person exists, and perhaps they do, I will *not* ever have the luck to meet them. You tell me I have to love myself before anyone else will. Those who grow in complete solitude don't even learn a human language. So tell me, if there is nobody to show me how to, how do you expect me to teach myself to love myself? I think you just want to place the blame on me. I don't 'love' myself and so that's why I am miserable. Not because of depression, not because of isolation, not because of poverty, not because of heartbreak, it's because I don't love myself in a world that's only taught me to hate and criticize myself. In this world where the people I thought I could perhaps give my heart to, say 'I care about you' and then show me those words are meaningless. Forgive me for being skeptical about getting better when I've only seen my life decline since it began. I'm not even asking for pity, because I know it's just the luck of the draw and I was dealt a particularly shitty hand. But can you please understand that not all of us are going to be okay in the end? Just because you suffered for many years and I've suffered for many years and you no longer suffer like you used to, doesn't mean I'm not going to continue suffering as I always have been.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Drug addict friend!!? I have had this best friend for over 8 years now. We were childhood friends and basically grew up together. The past 2 years were a little rough because he started to drink heavily in high school. Later on he started to dabble into drugs and the “party life”. Once he started doing that, I kind of distanced myself because I didn’t know how to react. I was kind of mad but also sad so I didn’t really talk to him as much. Fast forward to now, I talk to him more but I don’t know if it will ever be the same. He is always talking about trying new drugs and doing all this stuff at parties which tbh I don’t really care for. Should I still attempt to have that relationship we once had? I still care for him but it’s so hard to listen and be there for him when he’s putting himself in dangerous situations. If I stop being friends with him, does that make me a bad friend for not sticking through it? Should I stay friends to try and make a positive environment? HELP ‪",reddit_train.csv
"Post: How do I reconcile with a failed friendship from the past Earlier this year, I met a Colombian woman in my state and failed at my attempts to date her; many of our disagreements surrounded my personal history of morbid obesity. Although I am 5'9'' and now weight around 240 lbs, I have weighed nearly 400 lbs as a teenager and young adult. We dined together and talked to each other for around two weeks. Within that timeframe, I became very disaffected by her constant criticisms of other men she dated, such as her issues with their hygiene, lack of direction, etc. After talking to her nearly everyday, she suddenly asked me ""Do you think we're dating?... I think we can only be friends."" I immediately parted ways with her, informed her of my thoughts on her demanding and emotionally draining ways, very bluntly told her that I didn't like her, and directed her to no longer communicate with me. After another two weeks, she texted me out of the blue and said she ""understood"" my anger, asked to reconnect saying that she though I was a ""beautiful"" person, and eventually informed me that her ""biggest concern was my weight."" After another month, we went out (with me spending money for gas, etc.) and explored multiple regions in my state. She kept encouraging me to lose weight and gave me a diet book. Within the last times we spoke, she confided in me that she was an undocumented immigrant and told me - in anguished tears - about a failed marriage here in the U.S., as well as unwanted sexual encounters she faced here. I offered my help, but she declined any of my attempts to reconcile her immigration status. After another week, I became very depressed about not meeting specific weight targets. I eventually broke down, said I felt ""less than human,"" and asked if we could postpone any further in-person meetings until I could lose enough weight. Over the weekend, she ignored my texts; I drove to her home to see if she was okay and noticed her car was parked outside. She eventually texted me, saying that I was a person with ""unfriendly attitudes"" sometimes. Later in the day, she told me that hearing me talk of my weight was tiring. I was so baffled I couldn't get out a response. After that, she told me that I am ""too sensitive,"" looked at the criticism as an insult, and then mockingly told me ""everything hurts you, everything affects you."" I told her that ignoring me was inherently wrong and hung up. She then gave me a long text ending that I should ""just be happy... happiness isn't just about body image."" I need advice on how to handle situations like this. My gut reaction was to tell her she was a ""selfish bitch"" and hang up the phone. Looking back, that's probably what I needed to do, because that's exactly what I was thinking at the time. Secondly, I need to really reevaluate a relationship with a therapist who told me that cutting her off the first time I did was the wrong thing to do. I am holding a serious grudge against him, particularly as I don't trust him anymore. In sum, I am unhappy in life - because of shit like this. I try to be a good person and deal with human turds.

I got even more upset, and that seemed to genuinely confuse her. All I wanted in that moment was for her to say ""I'm sorry your pie didn't turn out, it'll be okay."" Or just something a human being with emotions would say to their upset daughter. This even just kind of exemplified what I get sick of in people. Even if you don't ""get it"" why is it so hard to realize that people have different priorities from you? Especially people who are depressed or have other mental illnesses. It can be a triumph for us to get out of bed some days. If we share an achievement or (more rarely) a failure with you, be with us in that emotion for a moment.

"Post: Family Problems - kicked out now moving out Issue: I have found myself unable to speak to my parents about anything. I have found, when I have problems, thinking of doing something new like get a job, am sick or just news about school or just talk want to talk about everday things that I go to speak to other family members, friends, or counselors before them who I felt more comfortable with, which would then get my parents irritated, and upset and make me even less likely to talk to them about anything because of how they reacted to me. This has been going on for years Except now it has gotten a lot worse. When I have important things to tell them about, such as news about school ( be it grades, tuition, classes etc ) appointments, invitations to a friend's wedding, or pretty much anything of that sort, I leave it to the last minute. Even thinking about telling them anything makes me feel extremely nervous - my heart speeds up and there's a pressure in my chest, I tremble, get headaches . As soon as I do talk to them I panic and change the topic to ask about something else, zone out , or I can't speak clearly at all. Because of my inability to tell them anything or even socialize with them has caused us to drift far apart. I am usually one to talk and My parents dont strike up conversation with and if I somehow must up the courage to do so I feel like they don't hear me and are quick to talk of all my shortcoming. ( My mom often talk about me negatively to her friends and y other relatives sometimes where I can hear) Anyways It doesn't go well. If they start the conversation it on a bad note . I have then avoided my family even more because of how they make me feel. I merely come home from school , do my chores and homework and staying in my bedroom ad stay out of their way. I have to admit I am not a perfect child, I have given my share of attitude etc. But I believe that most of it was because I am couldn't express how I felt or wanted to say or what I was thinking and wanted to expected them to know. While I don't drugs or curse, stay out late, outright disobey the. Etc acting this is considered disrespectful to them. At first,I just assumed it was a teenage phase a little bit worse than normal but I guess normal has been ruled out since I spend longs time in the bathroom to avoid them, hiding behind doors, flinching when I am talked to or even walking around different parts of the house to pretend I am doing something among other things . I don't know why I am like this. Or how I got like this( well maybe I have some idea) but I can't shake it. I have been advised to 'just go talk to them' but that is the very thing I cannot do! I don't think they understand how much pain this causes me when I have to gather my courage to even speak to them to ask for advice, and they rebuff me even now. I need some advice about how to proceed and handle this I have no more courage in me, low self esteem and probably some other things. I feel that my parents are not emotionally ..um supportive or open.. are so judgmental and critical I just can't. I've become isolating towards friends, restless at night and start eating all the time or not much at all. There are a few events that I think really hurt me and thus contributed to the problem overtime. examples: (Younger) they threaten to bring to boarding school and my mom even brings me to tell police station to proceed with the plan. - memorable beating from incident - memorable punishment of not letting me eat for a few days because I refuse to eat a seasme seed bun ( had sensitivity too, found out after) - memorable punishment mom knnew I was extremely afriad of the dark made me sit in the dark in the living roomfor hours of the night. - I was also left at home frequently ( with no cable , no internet) and missed out on many holiday events with family and outings. I cried a lot at first but overtime I learned to occupy myself with my own company. My mom would also leave me to clean the house as well. - little ""treasured"" things like cool pencils or little toys would be taken away.i don't know why but I never asked for them back, even afterwards nor would they give them back to me. (older) - Running away to school placement - struggling to secure financial assistance from my parents to help pay for my tuition. Scared the I have to drop out. -threatening to donate all my work earnings - and kicking me out of the house with no belongings. I have been torn between leaving and staying. Especially again with being cut off from my siblings as my stepdad prevent me from interacting with them after that. I finally left after a fight with my mom last week ( which included a rule on two day noticed before going anywhere... and talk to a worker about ending my life , which resulted her call the house concerned for my safety. Mom didnt take it very well and kicked me out) I have left and i'm trying work things out with myself and try to get better which is something I cannot do at home. I am staying with a friend, and hoping to rent a room , get a job and go for counselling soon. However, They are now feeling bad me and",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I should be an actor... I feel like most people who have depression could work in theatre or movies. I don't know how you guys feel about putting on an act when really you feel so sad that it's hard to breathe, but recently I have been having to act like I am getting better from depression. My roommate confided in me one day when I came back to our dorms that he struggles with depression. He was placed in a foster home after his parents died, and his foster mom committed suicide. After that, his friend also committed suicide, so of course this takes a toll on someones' emotional health. I told him that I started taking meds and going to therapy, and I smile and laugh and act like I am doing better so that he can feel encouraged to get help with his depression. I feel so fake though, even though I am getting help, I don't think it is helping me, my chest has that particular empty feeling and breathing is hard to do. I feel like crying a lot of the times now while I am laying down in bed, and driving to and from class. I would never let my roommate know that I was actually not doing better though. I really want him to get help because I see myself in him, and he is a really good person who doesn't deserve to be sad. I wish depression never existed, it is such a sick disease.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Desperate for advice or input; I lost and am losing everything held dear to me right now due to multiple reasons, and would just like to hear some different recommendations I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DONT KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG OR HOW TO FEEL BETTER!! I've typed this out way too many times so I'm gonna do my best to sum it up as short as I can: Last week me and my gf of 10 and a half months broke up, i was devestated. In that little time I have experienced more love, more of life than ever before and it felt like we'd been together forever. I thought, maybe we would work things out on our own and get back together when the time was right, even though i knew it was a stretch, but i was also okay with just being friends if that was what the world had planned. 2 days after the break up im talking to both of my best friends who are also (kinda?) friends with her, and they both tell me that she basically told them she had absolutely no intention of ever getting back with me because she wanted to ho around without the commitment of a relationship. She also openly bragged to one of them that she had cheated on me multiple times during our relationship. This all made me very angry and on top of that hurt. The same night just after finding all of this out I find out from my other friend that she had called her and bragged about hooking up with this one kid who, during our entire relationship, she told me she hated and that we BOTH already had bad history with, and fooled around. Then later (AGAIN) she goes on instagram live with my bestfriend who is kinda being fake just to see how she really is and openly brags about blocking me (which added to the hurt cause i had done nothing but try to respect her wishes since the split in hopes that we could at least part on good terms ya know) , saying that i was 'fucking crazy' and that she never wanted anything to do with me ever again. There's more in terms of details but thats the basic general idea of the past week for me. I dont know how i feel or what to say. I feel hurt and i feel abandoned and i feel stupid and i feel not good enough and i feel like a complete fuck up i feel so fucking awful its not even funny. Im losing my friends because my stupid brain cant get over this and im constantly going to them to talk about it because that's the way i like to deal with stuff, but they've heard the same thing one too many times and i get that i just dont know what else to do. Im tired of thinking about it, im tired of not being able to confront her but my friends say its not a good idea because its not gonna do anything but make her think even higher of herself for having fucked me up so badly and wont at all make her change her ways. I want to completely forget but at the same time a part of me wants to work everything out just so i can mean something to this person who meant absolutely everything to me at one point again, WHY?? Why does my brain, or heart, or whatever still crave attention from her, or maybe even her herself, even after knowing all of this? Why am i so fucking pathetic? What can I do to move on that doesn't involve just ignoring the problem and moving forward but rather coming to peace with it and myself and blossoming? Please, all and every opinion or suggestion is welcome. Thank you if you took the time to read this and I wish everybody the best of luck with your own problems no matter what they be. May peace of mind and soul find you all.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Grandmother asks for loan to estranged father, then refuses to carry debt I'm mostly estranged from my father who has narcissistic personality disorder, lives as a squatter in the forest, and works only part-time. Meanwhile, I work in Silicon Valley. His sister made a huge effort to contact me, which I ignored for months understanding that she likely has a personality disorder as well. Eventually, I relented and agreed to meet my father for dinner over the holidays. In February, I received a call from my paternal grandmother saying my dad needs a loan because he lost his temporary job (he has regular seasonal employment) and employment-insurance benefits have recently been changed where he lives. I called my dad and he asked for a loan of $5,000. I felt sorry for the guy, so I wired him the money. After further thought, I feel this is quite a bit more than he needs to be homeless for a few months and carry his credit card payments until getting new employment. Meanwhile, my grandmother has just sold her mobile home for $60,000 and left a voicemail to tell me of this and ask if I was willing to drive down and pickup some boxes. This isn't realistic, if I did go there I would fly rather than drive for 8 hours. I called her back and asked if she would assume her son's debt. This saves me the stress of servicing the loan and I have no interest in lending money whatsoever. Since she has cash from selling her house, she is easily able to do this now. Her son can pay her back. She told me that the money from the house was needed for her retirement and that she's ""on social security."" I responded, ""I'm saving for retirement too."" (I make the full $18,500 401(k) contribution each year to avoid ending up in the forest like my dad and this in addition to paying into social security which probably won't even exist when I am 67) ""That's no way to talk to your grandmother. I'm going to hang up if you..."" at which point I hung-up the phone. My instinct her is to forget about getting the money back and just disconnect from all three: dad, grandmother, and the aunt (who I should have just ignored). Any thoughts?",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I really need some advice *trigger warning* *trigger warning* Hi everyone. I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong. This is my first time visiting this subreddit, and so I don't know what's generally expected or done on here. Let me just get into this. I'm 22 and I've never experienced depression. I'm a Psychology major and I've taken classes over the topic, but I know reading about it can only give me so much insight. The reason I'm posting on here is because I have a 12 year old cousin who tried cutting herself the other day. She's depressed, says she wants to die, and I am so, so worried about her. She lives a few hours from me and is being watched closely right now, but I plan on going out to visit her this weekend. To be honest, she has a horrible living situation. My aunt (her mom) is awful. To my aunt, every problem can be solved by God, she's financially fucked and letting it out on my cousins, and she's extremely dismissive of my cousins feelings, needs, and emotions. It also doesn't help that my cousin is adopted, and I know she just feels detached from her own family. Anyways, I know that there's no such thing as simply getting your advice on how to fix my cousins depression. I know how complex of an issue this is. What I want to know from you all is if there is anything I can do this weekend to just show her that things can get better. My little cousin has always looked up to me, and I plan on taking her out to do some of the things that she always wants to do (like go to the park, make slime, whatever 12 year olds like). But is there anything extra I can do? Is there anything that you all wish someone told you? Or maybe even something you wish they didn't? I would really appreciate any tips or advice you all have for me this weekend. I know my cousin has a very long road ahead of her, but I want to do anything I can to make it easier. Thank you. tl;dr my 12 year old cousin is depressed and attempting to hurt herself. I'm going to visit her this weekend. Is there anything I can do (or shouldn't do), that might at least show her that things can get better.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I always feel like I will never achieve my dreams and I am a failure. I have a big dream where I want to help people in those poor countries and volunteer in charity works. The issue that really concern me at the moment is child labor. I hate to see children working to earn money and live in poverty when they are supposed to learn and enjoy their childhood. Another dream of mine is to pursue in the post graduate program after finish my degree. That is very difficult for me as I need a good GPA to get the financial loan. I think I didnt do well in my study at the moment. I dont think I am able to continue my study in master program. I always hate myself because I feel like I lack a lot of thing. I have a social anxiety where I love being alone, I feel nervous when talking with someone else. I avoided my highschool friends because I think I cant fit well. I am afraid to talk in front of the crowd, I am not able to express myself well. I hate that I am incapable to defend myself sometimes. I feel self loathing. I wake up every morning feeling the same thing, feel I will never accomplish anything. I see some of my friends are married, have their own cars and good jobs. I am stuck here and doing nothing.

"Post: I just drove 1000 miles cause my Gma tried to OD and is in ICU. IDK if this belongs here. Maybe it will get removed, but I feel like I need to vent somewhere. My grandma has struggled with manic depression a lot through her life. I've always seen her as this strong independent woman. She has always been my favorite family member because just how kind and loving she is toward everyone and everything. No matter how bad life has ever gotten for me or anyone else she has always had positive words. Well I never knew it but she's a bottler and my dad told me in the 90s she snapped and try to OD roughly 20 years ago. Combination with anxiety and stress and lots of other factors. Keep in mind everyone loves this woman she has 3 granddaughters and 1 grandson and loving kids. This woman is a saint in my family. He we are 20 years later again. My family and I live in Texas, meanwhile they live in Georgia and my dads sister/ gmas daughter and her family live in Virgina. My aunt plans to move back to TX. So my grandparents were planning to move to TX since everyone on the East Coast is leaving. When it came down to sign on a Realtor she snapped I guess again.... These are people in there 70s trying to uproot their life again and move across country. She tried to OD on some pills and my dad, sister, and I hopped in the car yesterday and drove from Tx to Ga. My Gpa said he noticed she was eating less but didn't see the signs. Now we surprised her and didn't tell her we were coming. Amongst other family all were happy to see us. My Gma I could tell wasn't the rock solid woman I always known her to be. It made me realize that you can be 70yo and still have these dark thoughts and try. She looked so weak and frail. So here I am in a different time zone trying to support my gma the best I can. My sister doesn't even know, she just thinks she's 'sick'. This woman has all the love in the world and that still doesn't help dark thoughts. IDK how I feel, I don't know how I'm coping. It hasn't hit me yet I think... Also my Gpa literally would not survive without her. Like she's the one that makes sure bills are paid on time and basically runs the house. She's his guide and he'd be lost and a wreck without her. Hes so shaken up and worried. On top of everything my girlfriend just tried the same thing but a different method and her brother called the cops and she got 5150'd and I've talked her once in 3 days. When she called I had just learned about my gma and I feel like she didn't get the support she needed from me. It breaks my soul to think that this loving amazing person would want it to go all away and leave all of us behind. I have so many cherished memories of my grandparents. Sometimes I feel like I can get these stints of depression and I know it runs in the family. So here's me unbottling to you guys in hopes to here thoughts, prayers, and reddit love.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: A letter to … my sister, who has conquered her depression The letter you always wanted to write... Family stuff happened and those wounds in you festered and festered. No one knew at the beginning. You hid it well under your sleeves and at the back of your eyes. Before it all happened, I sometimes looked at you and thought that this would happen to you. It is the way you used to hold your emotion. It is as if you were full to the brim with it, but you forced it down, shoved it into a box and hid it away. It was strange, but I was too young to understand. And then, slowly but surely, it took you over. You were so young. In my worst nightmares I imagined finding your lifeless body. I couldn’t wake you up. You wouldn’t wake up. My darling sister, even now I still imagine your cold body. How can such a deathly and frightening disease exist? You wasted away. Your cheeks were concave, and you didn’t even have to bend over for every bone of your spine to be visible. Your sharp wit and intelligent mind dulled. Your eyes were dark holes in your face. They were so empty. You slept all afternoon and night. I would lay my cardigan over you so you wouldn’t get cold. But I don’t think it made a difference. You were lost to us, floating in some different universe with no anchor or thread holding you to us. And then you tried to end it all. Multiple times. When I think about it, I blame you sometimes. But I know that the blame is not really towards you. It is towards me, of course. I am your sister. I should have been your protector. Is it OK if I say that I couldn’t really do anything but stand there and watch it run its course? Or is that just an excuse? You are my best friend, even though I am not always yours. I wish I would be kinder to you, but I probably will always hold some of myself away. Maybe I am punishing myself. I don’t know. No one can say it didn’t take a toll on all of us. You probably don’t remember, but we were going to the corner shop together once. As we chatted, you were vehement that you were a failure. I asked you, what on earth were you a failure at? What life had you lived that you possibly could have failed? And you said: “I failed at life.” So what was the alternative, my dear? Death? I’m telling you, I lived those few years in the fear that you would be taken away from us by your own hand. Even as I am writing this, I don’t know where to start or end. In my mind, it is such a mess. It doesn’t matter because you are well now. I have never seen someone work harder. You are radiant and beautiful and clever and sarcastic and so special I couldn’t tell you how much if I tried. I hope you will always appreciate the battles you have fought and won. I hope you always believe you are a success. I wish you all the happiness you deserve. Love you, babe. Your sister",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Doctor taking me off meds Cold Turkey Hi everyone, I've been on Prozac (Fluexetine) since 9th grade. I am a 2nd year student in college now. For the past few years I've been upped from 10mg, to 20mg, and now 40mg. I've been on 40 mg for 3 years. When I went to my doctor it was only to tell him during a check up that I was comfortable with my medicine and dosage, so he would send more prescriptions to my pharmacy. During my last visit, I expected it to be a quick and simple check up as usual, but instead he said he was prescribing me ""3 more months"" of 40 mg Prozac then making me stop cold Turkey because ""being on Prozac for more than 6 months is bad"". I don't understand because he has been constantly renewing my prescription for years and never said anything about tapering off or stopping. I once went a month cold turkey during a health insurance issue and around the 3rd week I had attempted suicide. And addressing the ""3 months"" he promised, I was quickly informed the pharmacy was only given 1 month of medicine for me I've been admitted to a mental hospital by my mother after I got raped and beaten, because I drank a lot of alcohol for a few days. I've been to several therapists. I've been rationing my pills 1 every 2 days, and my mother and fiancée who I live with have already seen a drastic change in my behavior. I feel awful because they give me such a nice and comfortable life but I am still depressed. I don't know what to do when I have no more antidepressants after 5+ years and then going cold Turkey.

"Post: My mother pt.2 I posted about my issues with my mother the other day, and I have discovered new information. She's been complaining to her boyfriend, and he has a busy mouth, so naturally he's spilled it all. I've learned that my mother never wanted me to move back in with her after I lost my apartment, and she's been saying she buys me lots of things: clothes, computers, etc. And I just toss them aside and never use them, because I'm an ungrateful child. So she just took the stuff and started wearing the clothes. None of that is true. What's probably going on here is that she's buying herself things, and using me as a scapegoat so she doesn't have to tell her boyfriend she has money, or bought things for herself. Or she's just delusional and making shit up. Maybe even that she's stealing clothes from me and covering that way. I could believe any of that. Either way, she wants me to leave, and I know she does. And that hurts like a mother. No pun intended. What I want to do is get custody of my younger brother, and leave the state. Just start over, and make sure my brother is raised in a safe and nurturing environment. Because I can't live with knowing that he's growing up in the same toxicity that I did, and how it'll fuck him up like it did me. She's two-facing everyone; talking shit to one person, then smiling to the person's face she just trashed. And if anyone tries to call her out, she gets pissed and plays dumb. Her sugar daddies have been showing up at the house. She does drugs on the daily. She's going to end up old, a lone, and with her kids and family hating her, no one coming to see her.

"Post: Zoloft made me fly off the handle I have episodes of clinical depression that last a few weeks alternating with episodes of being euphoric, having so much energy, and thinking I am the greatest person in the world and I have superpowers. It’s awesome but has issues of its own because I tend to make poor choices, act conceited/rude without realizing it, and sometimes get angry. I was on Zoloft for a short time (age 11-12) and it made me a little less depressed but caused me to do horrible things impulsively, act spoiled and stuck up, and have frequent fits of rage. I attempted suicide within the first month of taking meds. I developed anorexia, made poor sexual and financial decisions, and was fired from my Saturday job as a babysitter because I was yelling at the kids, teaching them how to swear and bragging about it to other teachers, and trying to flirt with the children’s fathers. At school I told everyone I had superpowers and raged at them when they said that my superpowers were not real. I had arguments with my parents and pulled out a knife to threaten them at one point. I had a boyfriend but was still flirting with other boys constantly including my teachers. I tried to “rapebait” by going into the house of a suspected molester/murderer/drug dealer but was stopped thankfully. After going off meds I crashed and burned HARD.

"Post: I want to fix my best friend and I's friendship, but I'm not sure if I should... any advice? Hi! I'll try to make this as short as possible, but you can ask me for more details if you want to. My best friend (19/f) and I (19/f) met two years ago. We're polar opposites, but we somehow became very close, and eventually started calling each other best friends (and other nicknames haha). It was awesome, and she's the only person I feel that close with -- she's like family (though I never told her that). Back in July though, I was feeling very drained. My best friend deals with severe depression and I was helping her a lot through it, willingly so. Honestly I felt fine for a year but I've been going through a huge identity crisis, trying to find myself and trying to know myself. I felt so confused and lost with myself -- I didn't know what I wanted anymore. It was bad. It was very exhausting for me mentally but I thought the cause of how I felt was my best friend. You might ask why I thought that, well, whenever we'd hang out, I'd have to go out of my house. I'm an introvert, and I deal with a lot of anxiety, I always feel uncomfortable being outside. But considering I'd only go outside to hang out with my best friend, I thought *she* was the problem. I took me a while but I eventually decided, even though I didn't really want to, to end the friendship. I thought this would make me feel better, like it was the key to my happiness or something. After I overcame the ugly crying phase that lasted for a week after I ended the friendship, I was feeling really good... for only a week. It was a sense of freedom like ""I don't have to worry about anything anymore!!"". I started missing her real bad though. But I thought, hey, maybe I just miss the IDEA of her, and not really HER. So I waited to see if my feelings would change over time. Back in september, uni started. We shared the same classes. We saw each other again and I thought it was a good opportunity to talk to her again and explain some things out, and especially apologize to her (we had a bad argument when I told her I was ending the friendship), and she apologized too. She was really excited because some of her guy friends were with her at uni and she wanted me to hang out with them. I was still questioning a lot of things about myself at this point, and I was terribly anxious about starting uni, and also because I was scared her friends wouldn't like me or think I'm too ""innocent"" or whatever. So I chickened out and decided to avoid her. Two days later, I dropped out of uni (not because of her), and didn't say a word. I was feeling ashamed about dropping out and I had issues at home that made me feel really depressed, so I isolated myself BAD. I pushed all of my friends away, and eventually ended up alone, well, I still had some internet friends, but they didn't last long because I ended up ignoring everyone's messages. Fast forward to now. I still miss my best friend terribly. Some days are worse than others. I thought I'd be over it by now but I always end up crying at night because I just want to talk to her and hang out like we used to. I tried to distract myself as much as I could, and I tried to make new friends, but every time, I ended up realizing that I was just trying to find someone to replace her, which obviously didn't work out. I realized that I talk about her everyday still to my parents. My mom actually asked me how she was doing and I had to remind her that we're no longer best friends. I still think very fondly of my best friend so when I talk about her, or think about her, it's like nothing happened. I dream about her too sometimes. I want to contact her again. I want to explain to her everything I was feeling and tell her I want us to be friends again. But I'm scared. It looks like she's completely moved on from me, and she has this new (guy) friend and they seem really close. It makes me sad because I feel like I've been replaced and I won't be able to be her best friend again. I want to be here for her, laugh with her, cry with her, hang out with her, be by her side during the best and worst moments. I don't want to be with anyone else. Just her. I can't blame her for finding new friends and moving on, also her new friend seems like a really great guy, I actually think I'd get along with him. But I don't know, it still makes me feel sad. It makes me feel like I shouldn't contact her because she doesn't need me in her life anymore and she forgot about me. I'm aware this is probably the case though. I've been thinking of making an audio where I just talk about what's on my mind and talk about our friendship and send it to her. I'm so scared though. Is this a good idea or should I just drop it? It really makes me feel sad and I'm crying way too much over this -- I feel like, even if we can't be friends again, I need some closure. I didn't tell her everything when I ended the friendship, I only told her something like ""we don't click anymore"", I'm not even sure because it was a lie. I didn't want to hurt her feelings by saying her",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I’m just not fucking good enough. My parents fucking hate me, just a few hours ago they were fucking ranting about how I’m not pulling my weight and about how my grades are failing and I’m a failure by extension, my “friends” are slowly jumping ship one by one because “I’m not mentally stable” and nobody actually fucking cares. I’m ugly as hell, my face can be described as if Satan sneered his shit on the earth, I’m probably stupid, and everyone I know would be better off without me. The three people who actually fucking cared about me are fucking dead because of me One of my two best friends died in a car crash because he was getting me a stupid birthday gift, my other best friend killed her self because I let my guard down and wasn’t there when she needed it, and my aunt drug overdosed two weeks ago, she wouldn’t have been on them if I hadn’t put that unnecessary stress on her My grades are fucked, I’m fuckin stupid, I’m goddamn hideous, and I fuck up everything I see, I finally see why nobody fucking wants me, I’m just a fucking burden to everyone I know, and every time I attempt suicide I fuck it up cuz I’m a fucking moron... my therapy didn’t work, antidepressants made me feel worse, I guess I’m a hopeless human being.

"Post: Tipped off by someone that best friend is not okay It's been a semester in college and people here are very interesting. Recently, I [F] made a best friend Theo* [M] in class. We're both in the same major, speak the same native language, and he always helps me understand the homework (he's smarter than me), meaning that we spend about 2 hours/day together, if not more. We got super close within a few weeks, and I started to develop a crush on him. But I have a boyfriend (long-distance), and my feelings for Theo were not sexual, so I resolved to think of Theo as just an older brother - it hasn't been a problem for a few weeks now. We still hang out as best friends. My primary means of communication with him is facebook in our native language. A week before, he added me on snapchat, but we never talk on it. The other day, I got a snap with a mispelling of my name, to which I sent a question mark. The day after, I got a snap from a girl Lucy* claiming to be Theo's boyfriend, who told me she got my username from Theo. She told me that he was acting weird, and for my name w/mispelling, to look out for him since they were also long distance. I don't know how to approach the situation. I want to make sure that Theo is okay, since I did have some problems with suicidal/bored/lonely friends before. But he never told me that he has a girlfriend or about Lucy, and when I took to other forms of social media to find her, I couldn't find her - she wasn't in any tagged photos of Theo either. I may be completely over thinking, but I also think that Lucy has ascess to Theo's snap, which is how she got to me - meaning that I'm not sure if Theo knows that I know Lucy. If she has ascess to the snap, she could also have acess to his facebook (although I'm pretty sure she can't speak our native language).... Basically, I'm not sure how to approach him to ask if he's okay okay. I always ask how his day was, and it ranges from okay to sleepy. So if I ask if he's okay, he might ask me why I thought he wasn't okay, and I don't think I can say his girlfriend was wondering - we don't talk about relationship stuff, I don't think he know I have a boyfriend, although this is posted all over my social media. Going down a rabbit hole - please help!",reddit_train.csv
Post: I have a bad personality that appears good. My personality is a result of childhood abuse and depression. I was treated like a subordinate not worthy of shit growing up and now as an adult I'm a people pleaser to the extent of ruining my own life to help others even if they dont need it because I worry about my reputation and want people to constantly think I'm a really good person. I know that it isn't good behaviour but I don't know how to be outside of that. It feels nice to get praised for it but I really want to start accomplishing things for myself and let people handle their own business. I want to be someone. I don't even feel like a person half the time. There are too many ways to be and I don't know which one is a good fit for me. It's definitely not this. I'm not really sure what to do and I'm sure no one could really answer this for me but I really wanted to get it off my chest. Idk if anyone else is like this but it sucks. I was doing some research and found martyr syndrome and it really kicked me off my pedalstool and I feel like a piece of shit that sets too high standards and takes too much responsibility on and makes people feel bad. I thought I was just a super nice person but I'm actually an asshole victimizing myself constantly and blaming it on others. TL;DR: I have a bad personality and I want to find a new one that is better.,reddit_train.csv
"Post: How to Make Friends When No One Likes You A little background, in 4th grade my teacher would encourage bullying me (she got fired the end of the year) and I pretty much grew up taught it was okay to be bullied, so I never learned to stand for myself. That obviously left a lot of scars, and my depression (diagnosed in 7th grade) makes me isolate myself a lot. I don't want to sound like I'm looking for sympathy, and sorry if I am. But now I have mere months left in the school year of my senior year and I still have absolutely no friends. I am friendly and I try to be as outgoing as I can, it feels like everyone is keeping me at an arm's distance though. Is it me? It must be, I don't know why but something about me just makes others hate me. I'll ask how someone's day is going and often the reply is just a short ""pretty good"" and then that's it. I refuse to beg for friendship or to force anyone to talk to me so when they walk away or leave I'll just accept it, wave and say ""see ya around"" or etc. How do I get people to be my friend though? I don't smell, I am ugly but I try to cover that up best I can with makeup. I just want to feel like I belong somewhere with someone.",reddit_train.csv

I had two internships last summer, one in venture capitalism and one teaching middle schoolers how to code. I have a potential internship lined up for a Fortune 500 company in Miami next summer and potentially an private equity internship lined up. I have all the networks and connections in the world to be successful. But I feel so unhappy and miserable with my life. My thoughts are so irrational and negative that I can't see how fortunate I am to have all that I have. I make great money with my summer internship, more money then most adults make, but none of that matters, because I still have suicdial thoughts almost everyday. I feel hopeless all day, everyday.

Post: IDK WHAT TO DO ANYMORE AH IM IN SUCH A DILEMMA. Basically I have this friend whom I’ve known for 10+ years and we’ve always been quite different but were good friends nonetheless. Over the past 3 years this friends true colours have been slowly creeping out and its been really affecting me! Most recently she did some that was way out of line and really made me question who she is! I’ve tried cutting her out slowly and distancing myself but I can’t really escape it since our university campuses are the same and she’s recently joined a club I’m in! She’s basically just so fake around me and is so nice to everyone else and I ignore it and let it slide but the thing she did that was way out of line is something I can’t get over? She also always makes me feel guilty for what I have and always makes me out to be just ‘lucky’ but nothing I have ‘have’ is due to luck! It’s literally pure hard work??? And now that she’s joining this club it’s gonna make things 1000x worse because she’s just going to show off to all the guys and be this super fake ass person? She thinks she can get away with it and basically try walk all over me just because she’s known me for ages cause otherwise she literally follows everyone else like a sheep? I’ve tried confronting her about her actions but she just laughs it off??? How can I just get over it all ready?? It’s really beginning to affect my mental health 😭 like I didn’t really speak either her over the last 2 months and I’ve never been happier but seeing her around college more literally makes my blood boil she’s honestly just so toxic and I feel like hanging with her in this club is going to ruin my reputation and what others think of me! I just don’t want to be associated with her anymore 😭😭,reddit_train.csv

"Post: Not good enough. Greetings, everyone. I am currently in need of venting my thoughts. Reddit seems like the perfect environment for fucked up people, like myself. I've come for the wisdom and maybe even the charming assholes. So, here's the scoop: Growing up, I was always compared to a specific relative. I won't say which, because I'm a paranoid fucker. But we shared the same gender, were of similar ages, and were always very different from each other. Still, we were extremely close. The biggest difference was our weight. Yes, I was always the ""larger"" one. People enjoyed to point it out, but what really stung was that our own family would as well. Fast forward to years later, when we were in our teenage years. It became so much more than our weight. Our family started comparing our physical appearances. They were always the more ""attractive"" one. The more ""successful"" one. We are both adults now. Our grandmother speaks wonders of this person, and only has negative things to say about me. Despite all of this, I was always deemed the ""nicer"" one. That hasn't mattered a single bit. I constantly beat myself for picking up the phone when our grandmother calls, because I give her personal details of my life only for her to turn around and use it as juicy gossip material. She is very sick, and I assume quite close to death. I pick up because I feel massive guilt when I ignore her calls, while my ever-so-""better"" relative ignores them with no problem, and is still worshipped. I've considered cutting ties with my entire family. I don't believe they genuinely care about me. Yeah, I'm struggling. Bad. I'm basically at rock bottom right now. Still, I highly doubt my wellbeing is in their best interest at all. I don't think I'll ever be the picture perfect grandchild, child, sibling, whatever. It drowns me deep in self-loathing every day.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Gossiping in the family Hello. I am not sure whether this fits in this sub but I am going to ask it anyway. My family is a known gossiper. All of them tend to gossip about me. I am the odd ball, the one who doesn't agree with them. The one they all tend to chat about. Many times we have arguments, they all gain up on me. I will have my mom, dad, and older sisters all attacking my character- telling me I am no good and that I am poison . I have caught them in a few instances; but they brush it off. Often, they pretend I am being paranoid or they play dumb and be like, ""I did nothing, we said nothing."" Sometimes they complain about someone else to use it to get to me. It's really bothersome. It makes me feel so betrayed, confused, and really angered. I also not my family learns things about me before I even told them- mainly negative. There are lists of inconsistent gaps. I try to confront them but they immediately dismiss me. They try to cover up their tracks and always tell me I am paranoid. I know lots of the advice will be to confront them, but I do not believe that will work. I have tried that- all kinds of approaches but they insist they did nothing even when I catch them saying things about me. My mother does it the most. Often she, gossips after work with my sisters or sometimes with my dad. Sometimes my sisters gossip about me together. I have become the play thing in the family- my problems and life is just a giant joke they can share their contempt for. It's hurts. It's hard not to give a shot because it's your own family. I have considered audio recording secretly but that is creepy and invades their privacy despite they do that with me often. It's also wrong to play the same game. What should I do? I really am at a loss.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Post-Graduation Depression I recently graduated from college, and over the past couple of months I’ve grown increasingly depressed. I feel this profound sense of loss and it feels as if the color has drained from the world. What’s shocking to me is that I honestly hated college - I was either working or studying 24x7. I rarely had a single moment for myself or friends and was constantly exhausted and anxious. Now, I have a great job, live with my girlfriend, have almost no debt (thanks to working so much in college), and live in my ideal area. My life is comparatively so much better, but I feel this knot in my stomach as if I just finished a good book or beat the story of a video game and now I’m finally seeing how much of myself I’ve given up to get to where I am. Life feels devoid of adventure and I feel like I have no passion left.

"Post: Friend emotionally unloads on me? I have a particular friend from highschool who always wants to meet up with me. We were good friends then purely due to convenience I feel, and over time we’ve become really different people. She had a bout of depression and has been struggling with these issues for several years now. I don’t feel like she’s responded to my own issues well, and for some reason her method of reassuring me is to “move on, and get over it”. I’m not quite sure how I feel about that considering I would never say that to her. It’s gotten to the point where she would occasionally send me messages on Facebook about her ill mental health and says that I am the only one she can talk to about this, despite having a boyfriend and other friends already. I want to cut her off, but at the same time for some reason I feel guilty to? Like here’s an emotionally vulnerable person and I’m not sure if I’m just adding to her despair. But I dread seeing her messages and I get tired thinking about her. I’ve also suggested professional help but she’s shot that down many times. Am I thinking too much into this?

"Post: Are friendship ultimatums a good or bad thing? I have this friend who've I've been friends with for about 7 years. She moved across the country and is depressed for not knowing anyone she can be friends with. She's been making me feel bad about not going there to visit her. I've told her several times, I'm broke and have school obligations. Every time we talk, she brings up how she misses me and just needs a hug, and have someone (me) brush her hair, and hang out with her. Recently, I've found out that she feels there's an inequity in our friendship over the past year; because I haven't gone to visit her. I personally feel I've been there for her and her child whenever she needed me and dropped everything and go see her whenever her and her ex-husband and ex-best friend would have a fight. About two months ago, my S.O. made a bad joke and she ended up lashing out on him and making a comment about a subject that I told her in confidence, and ended up hurting me as a result. We talked about it, and tried to go back to normal. But, I realized, that I'm still hurt by her comment and told her that. She then says she's going through a lot right now and can't deal with me going back and forth on my feelings. So she said I need to ""figure my shit out"" and let her know if we can move past this or end our friendship. I've been doing some thinking and I'm torn on whether or not to try to get over this feeling of betrayal, or just completely end the friendship all together.

"Post: How do you talk about depression to your friends? I'm really ashamed of not necessarily the depression in and of itself but the way that I have acted with it and the way that I have (so far) failed to overcome its clutches.

"Post: Why depression is, and isn't like a skinned knee: Some thoughts I had that I wanted to share I was just pondering depression, and I decided to jot down what I was thinking. It's sort of a good way to put words to what it feels like to suffer from depression. ____________________________________ Why it IS like a skinned knee: Depression usually comes in episodes for me, and a lot of people I've talked to. Sometimes I'll be doing okay, and then have a really bad day, or even a bad week. These episodes are sort of like skinning your knee. When you were little, skinning your knee feels like the absolute worst thing in the world. You think, ""OW, THIS HURTS SO MUCH! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!"" You feel so helpless. When you're an adult and skin your knee, you know what to do. You know that you're supposed to clean it, and put a bandage on it. And that's exactly what you do; you don't make a fuss. But, even though you clean it and bandage it, it's of course still going to hurt. It's a cut. You just ignore the pain, though, because you've already taken care of it, and there's not much else you can do beyond that. You just have to live with the fact that it's going to hurt for a while. Depression is the exact same way. When it happens, you know what you should do to handle it. The best way, backed by science and research, is what we've all heard countless times: Exercise, eat healthy, do something nice for yourself, clean your living space, listen to happy music, watch TV shows that make you happy, etc. So you know to do this stuff. But of course, it's not going to magically feel 100% better right off the bat. There's still that emotional pain there, just like the way a skinned knee stings. But you've already done everything you can to take care of it, so you have to live with it and wait patiently for the pain to go away. ______________________________________________ Why depression ISN'T like a skinned knee: Most people know that depression has a way of demotivating sufferers. Things you once enjoyed no longer interest you. Nothing seems like it has a point. But this also affects your drive to treat your depression. When you skin your knee, you just take care of it right away, you don't give any second thought to it. It's just what you do. With depression, you know that you should be exercising, eating healthy, listening to happy music, cleaning, etc. But you don't. What's the point? The difference is, that depression makes you NOT want to get better, or more accurately, not care about getting better. Sometimes, you're just apathetic and nihilistic, ""What's the point? I don't care. Getting better is too much effort."" Sometimes, you just want to wallow in your own despair. For me, when I feel this way, it's because I feel worthless and self-loathing. I think, ""I deserve to feel this way. I deserve this emotional pain that I'm going through. I don't deserve to feel better, or to be happy."" That's the vicious cycle that depression uses to keep you down. If you are reading this and have depression, I hope this helps you understand your own illness a little more clearly. If you're reading this and you don't have depression, I hope this gives you a good account of what it's like, so you can empathize with people who have depression.

So it's a long story and I'll try and keep it to the parts the are mine to tell to keep things less complicated. So first things first me and my mother have had a somewhat rocky relationship from since I can remember, it was more of a rollercoaster and have been estranged for a year. Although the intense emotional disrupt from the relationship has lasted much longer. A brief history of this would be as follows, since a young age my mum has never been the ""settle down type"" she was always away either to holidays guys she would meet online would take her on too out every weekend. Me and my sister had to learn fast from a young age that we weren't able to live a childhood like most of our friends and basically raise our little brother. Sometimes she would be caught leaving us alone for so long and we'd have to stay with her friends so she wouldn't get in trouble and others we'd have to just make sure not to miss school so she wouldn't get caught. After years of this repeated behaviour some days easier some harder living from feast (when mum would bag herself a wealthy guy) too mum didn't win at bingo this week and a 40 fag a day habit is expensive habit to keep up why don't you just have beans on toast tonight, ofcourse I know that this is better than alot of kids we had a roof over our head and food in our stomachs it was always just chaos. Cut forward to my mum deciding she wanted to move back to ireland. I was about 10 at the time and and as such didn't want to move that's when the abuse went from none of my boyfriend's stay because of my kids too physical, she had us all so scared saying that while we were staying with grandad and granny and they heard us complaining this is what we'd get she kick us or grab us, I had been beaten before by my dad before he left so this was nothing I couldn't handle and until now never really tried to think about since. I just remember that I stayed very quiet for those coming weeks. When we moved to Ireland it was just after the first week a man showed up at my grandparents came in kissed my mum and said hello to me and my sister and said he was so glad to meet us. Turned out he was engaged to mum.....and they were planing on being married within the year, all of a sudden the reason for moving became clear. So After the breakdown of their relationship the next week the man moved back to America in the night and that was that here we were living with my grandparents in Ireland with no where else to go, my mum a big believer of why would I have to work I have kids stuck. Now I know from mum's point of view this must of been a heart breaking moment, but looking back I think this is where alot of my sadness in life begins and I hate her for it. I know hate is a horrible thing to hold onto but it's the only thing that got me where I am today and kept me as a person and I'm definitely aware I'm no Ghandi so judge me all you want but wait until I'm finished atleast. The next few months were basically limbo, we moved too late to start the term at school so had to wait until the end of term and summer to join, that's from April till September if I'm remembering right of living in the middle of nowhere in Ireland, sleeping in a room with your young brother older sister nothing to do but wait for the day to end we would take walks here or there and get to go to mass on a Saturday night but minus that it's all we had I realised then that mum had failed to do the one thing that kept giving me hope that one day we could have a ""normal"" family she was nowhere to be found off on holidays for weeks one after the other while our grandparents fed us and kept us in their home. I remember a week going by without hearing anything from her and I had to assume that's it she's gone. Yet she came back this time more shiny and brand new then ever, she said she had found us a house not to far away and go to school and it was the start of our new life. So ofcourse I felt overwhelmed at how amazing this might actually be. Mum made sure though to show her appreciation that Christmas by starting a huge family row with my her brothers and my grandparents, they had all chipped in to buy me and my siblings bigger toys for Christmas, I got a playstation 2 my sister got clothes and makeup and a bike my brother got lego ect that kind of thing, now Christmas was never a thing for us mum had explained from a young age that the santa thing was a lie and we would get what she could afford again this is not as bad as it sounds I'd rather the truth always and she at the end of the day was a single mother why would we expect anything ""big"" so ofcourse she didn't like the gesture and disowned everyone there etc But we were moving to new house and starting a new life what more could I have wanted. So after living in the new house for a week mum decided that now my sister was",reddit_train.csv
Post: Nausea/heartburn from Wellbutrin I started about a week ago and was having some reflux beforehand but only really when I drank alcohol or had something really acidic. Now I’m avoiding all that and I still have issues everyday. I know heartburn is a side effect but the weird thing is that I take it right in the morning and then at fine all day until the evening while I’m getting ready to go to bed I’m just hit with bad nausea out of no where. I avoid eating before bed as well. Wondering if anyone else has this experience. I was maybe thinking of moving it to type evening but then I’m worried if there’s some 12 hour delay to it I’m just gunna wake up with the nausea which could be just as bad but at least it won’t effect my sleep. Or maybe it will just go away with time since I’m still pretty early on idk but it’s really fucking with me right now,reddit_train.csv
"Post: Dear depression, please please let me be. I know I can do so much good and actually get somewhere in life but you are constantly holding me down, suffocating me. Once I think I've escaped your grip you show me you never let go and I'm reminded of how tightly we are woven together. I can't breathe. I can't eat. I can't sleep. all I want is some peace. you creep into my bedroom at night when you know I'm alone. you destroy everything inside me until I'm just a hollow shell of a small sad girl. why?! why can't you let me be? let me succeed? you bring fear, doubt, guilt, all the bad thoughts. I run and fight for the little bit of light I see through my window in the morning. but every night you are back. sometimes you don't even leave and it can be days, weeks, months til I get another chance at seeing the light. This is not living, this is not a life i wish my son's to see in me. You have taken me from myself. it isn't fair. I just want to be free of your poison.

"Post: I [18F] finally feel like i’m getting better I was diagnosed with depression about 4 years ago. Honestly every single day for the past 5 years I have debated killing myself, I tried a few times but I was unsuccessful. Really I was down in a hole, couldn’t seem to find an escape. My parents tried their best but were at a loss. Finally, I met A [18 M] last september and we started dating in July. And he has been the most supportive person i have ever met, would take days off of work to take care of me when I was too sad, would help me talk through things, told me why he loved me and that the flaws didn’t matter to him. He is the absolute best and I haven’t even thought about suicide for the past three months. It gets better, I was really lost, was hoping i would die and I found my cure. Maybe your cure won’t be someone else, maybe it’ll be medicine or yourself but please don’t give up because i would have regretted it so much. The world has so much more to offer",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I always wanted to go to the therapy but my very huge and overprotective gossip-loving family made this impossible for me to do Not only that but even a little hypothetical talk about it would instantly gain unnecessary panic like attention and after several phone calls to friends, family members with something like *""Hey Clara, he wants to go to the therapist. Is this normal? Which one should we call? Do you know anyone? Ask John please!""* And next day there will be several people touching my hand and saying ""Hey are you fine?"" Making it feel like something is wrong with me when I just want to talk to a professional in person without feeling like a babe. How do I know? Because my sister was depressed once and I've seen how everyone reacted to it. You see, my family's never changing mentality is ""we need to fight together! We are there for you (goddamn Fairy Tail guild or something)"". I don't blame them and I bet there are people who'd exchange everything only to be with someone as supportive. But I have always hated attention so much since I remember my self as a kid. Ironically enough I've had the biggest birthday parties in the town to boost this 'weird' hate. Doing it secretly will be risky because I actually work in my family's business as well so my tight schedule and the fact that my town is pretty small makes this almost impossible. And if someone finds out I secretly go to talk to a doctor it will have even worse reaction than just straight out telling them. Maybe I'm overreacting and have too much pride in me or no balls to admit to my family but sometimes I wish I could get invisible for just a week to sort my inner problems out. Sorry If this feels like I'm trying to make it harder for you guys to make some suggestions. It's way more complicated than that I just wanted to let it out. I've read some posts here and some of them were so so dark that my problems actually fade away a bit and I felt better because I said to my self *""yo... you are being a bitch right now, look at these people suffering here, you aren't even close!""* (don't know if I'm being terrible for healing my little wounds by reading how other people suffer). Anyways, Idk why I haven't visited this sub earlier, as I type these last words I already feel better because it is the first time I'm doing something like this. Feels like I've talked to someone.

"Post: Ending a friendship (This post is insanely long FYI) I have a mate [17M, nearly 18] whose currently in a relationship with a girl [just turned 16] that he is completely infatuated by. He buys her stuff constantly, despite his financial situation (more on that later) and does lots of other things (also more on that later). This friend of mine completely revolves his life around this one girl. He once told me he would do anything for her and that he would kill himself if they broke up (he's also depressed, which I think he should fix before even being in a relationship but it's too late now) he also said he would feel 100% responsible if she were to kill herself (she's not depressed. It was hypothetical. When I told him it wouldn't be his fault as everyone is responsible for their own actions, I simply received a ""shut up"". There have been many incident like this where I've truth bombed him and he's stuck his head in the sand and might as well be saying ""lalala I can't hear you!"" Unfortunately for my mate, these feelings don't appear to be reciprocated. He buys her gifts all the time, even though his mum can barely afford fuel due to her unemployment and the fact she's a single mum. He bought her a bath bomb and perfume and other stuff for her birthday (would be upwards of $50 (Australian dollars btw if that's even a concern) from a family that sometimes has $0 in their bank account when he didn't even get anyone else (including me) a gift for our birthdays. The girl doesn't even seem phased by his financial situation or his depression. If she cared, wouldn't she ask to not have gifts to help him out?. Not to mention that she hasn't bought A THING for my mate. In real life they seem like a stable couple but it's much worse. The mate also purposely neglects invites from his mates (including me) for her. We invited him to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi and he messaged her about how he didn't really want to go (me and a mate broke into his Snapchat account. His iPad charger is broken and he can't afford another one so he gave us username and password to Snapchat so we could do his streaks which apparently matter. Also this is another testiment to his financial situation. Can't afford a cheapo third party cord for his iPad) We looked through his messages and pretty much he's sending ""almost nudes"" thankfully with consent and a thotty dog filter picture (even though he would call anyone else that did it a thot to fit in) he also constantly asked to call on discord to which she replied only with ""sorry"" or ""can't"". No explanation whatsoever. Her friends are also incredibly irresponsible (thankfully he sees through that) When my mate is talking to me or anyone else. All we get is a bombardment ""what if she doesn't like me"" and other relationship jargon. I don't care but I have to pretend to. He cannot talk about anything else ever. It's just relationship this relationship that. I'm sick of it. When he was at a very dark time in his life, me and 3 of my mates (2 girls including the girlfriend and one guy) made a group chat to talk about how we help him. We all talked very in depth except for the girlfriend. My mate asked her ""what do you think of all this were talking about (we went very in depth into his situation) to which her response was ""I don't know"" after saying NOTHING. I'm sick of his ignorance. I'm sick of him neglecting me and the other lads. I'm sick of it all. He even tried to seize control from his girlfriend. She went to hi five me and he said ""why are you bringing him over here"" in an incredibly annoyed tone"" I know I'm only the ""when Chloe isn't present talk to him isntead"" guy. He doesn't care. How do I cut him out of my life whilst causing the least ruccus possible? (I have 2 other friends who have identical opinions so if you offered advice I'd be able to tell them too) If you have anything I need to clarify please ask and I will do so.

"Post: The last 3 days felt like the first days of my life. Today feels like the beginning of the last days. I have been having depression since Senior Year. I have been fighting non stop for 5 years. I took gap years to fight depression. Until last October, I thought depression has gone cause i felt totally normal at that time. During the time, I had a lot of ups and downs. Lots of tears, lots of laugh. But i have never given up on myself Last November, my brother did sth bad. And my ex attempted suicide. That is when i got depressed again. The first time in 2 years Until 3 days ago, I met a girl. ""Perfect stranger"" is the word that would suit her the most. My situation with her is exactly like in the movie ""Before we go"" by Chris Evan. 2 strangers meet each other out of 7 billion people but they would never see each other again. And 3 days after we met ( we hung out everyday for the last 3 days), she is gone. We still keep contact but I dont think i would ever see her again ( please dont ask why). She knows about depression. She made me make a promise to reach out to her every time i get depressed. The last 3 days were the happiest days of my life. It feels like I actually live for the first time. But i also got depressed since. I got depressed because i couldn't recall her image. I couldnt recall her face. I couldn't recall what she looked like when we first met. And i couldnt remember why those were the happiest days of my life. I just recall those were the happiest. All i can recall is a brief moment of her smile for like 5-10 secs, her voice, and the moment when we were about to say good bye that i poured out my heart. Everything is so blurry. Then i went on to google to search for blurry memories and depression. And it leads me to ""depression and memory loss"" and "" depression and Alzheimer "" . Then i started to shed tears. I was thinking about the day i actually lost my memories. What if it actually comes, What if one day i wouldnt remember her, my mom, my best friends, and even myself ? I was teaching in class when i shed tears. I had to run to the bathroom and cried in there for 15 mins. Luckily noone noticed. I remembered my promise to her. I was about to text her. And then i started to cry again. I will bother her. I will make her worried. I will waste her time. And i cant afford to hurt people i love. This is the beginning of the end.

"Post: Every Day is Exactly the Same. I'm Lonely, Worthless, and Done With Life Every day, I wake up, go to work, come home, and go to sleep. That's basically it. That's my life. Sure, I have a few friends that I see on the weekends, but it only helps so much. My ex girlfriend broke up with me and moved out of our apartment 6 months ago now. The almost three years we were together were the only time in my life where my depression was pretty much nonexistent. When she came home that day and told me she was done, I was floored. I had no idea that she felt the way she did, and she wouldn't even discuss the matter with me. I've tried meeting other people since then, and I've gone on exactly three dates with one person. That's it. I'm basically invisible to women, and no amount of effort will ever change that. I just have to accept the reality that I hold absolutely no value in a romantic context. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's because my generation is only interested in people who are aesthetically in the top tier, or make the most money. Maybe it's because my generation is eschewing committed relationships in favor of having fuck buddies left and right, whoring themselves out to whoever will get their rocks off, both men and women are at fault for this. I don't think I'm a particularly unattractive guy, and I make a pretty damn good amount of money for my age, but since I'm not in that top 10% of men, I'm just always going to be passed over and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. It's almost like there something inherent to my existence that prevents me from having any intimacy. No matter how much money I make or how much I improve myself, that intrinsic quality of my being will always hold me back. I didn't ask for this, but it's the way things are, so I've pretty much given up completely. I don't have any plans of offing myself or anything like that. But every day, it gets harder and harder to convince myself that I actually have anything worth living for. The one thought I keep coming back to is how scared my cat would be if I gave her to a shelter or how she'd get by if I were gone. I love my cat, and she doesn't deserve to be put in a situation like that. I feel like she's the only thing keeping me marginally together. The thought of causing her any distress breaks my heart, and one of the big things on my mind all the time is simply making sure she's happy and feels safe. I feel worthless and frustrated. I wish I understood how to achieve what I want in life and be happy, but I guess that's just not in the cards. I can't wait until the day I die, I'll finally get some goddamn peace and quiet. I'm so tired of feeling broken. I'm so tired of constantly being reminded that there's something wrong with me, like I'm some sort of bastard aberration of what humans are supposed to be. I've struggled with this for 12 years now. I don't know how much more I can take.",reddit_train.csv

I fucked up college in the second year of my 2 year diploma course and got excluded for the same kind of shit previously mentioned but on a larger scale, this really fucked me up as I thought I'd end up doing nothing with my life when I really wanted to do something with it. 10 weeks ago I got a job and a paid for graduates course which pays out over £1100 per month after tax which is incredible for me, it's a job I love, work hard at and it's exactly the path I want to take in life career-wise. So I've been given a second start, I have money, great friends, a good social life and my life is on track but I still can't quite feel complete. I'm very social anxious and this affects my everyday life but I push through it, I have to. I smoke week almost everyday and I've been smoking for about 5 years now. The problem is, I still have a void that I can't fill and I can never really feel that happy by myself. I love my metal and I'm a huge music fan, I used to play a lot of games but I've stopped caring so much now. Sometimes I find it hard to enjoy things as much as I used to. I feel exhausted at home as I don't sleep much and the anxiety takes it out of me until I walk through the door. It feels as if it's getting worse and I don't know what to do and I don't even know why I feel this way. Sometimes it can get quite bad where I won't even feel like doing anything but pulling bongs with the TV on in the background as the day is just too much to handle sometimes. Sry for the huge wall of text but I'm trying to get this typed quick as I'm about to go out. I don't even know why I'm posting this really, I want to vent, maybe I want advise. I don't know, the fact that I'm even posting this means it's starting to get to me in some way.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: When people with good intentions say the wrong shit.. How do you deal with it? When someone who is just trying to help you says something that cuts you really deeply, or when they are pushing you when you just need them to back off while. How do you personally deal with it? Recently I had an Uncle who I was close with get involved trying to help with my depression and anxiety issues. He encouraged me to go see a therapist again for the first time in years and was just there to talk and encourage. Then when he saw progress he started pushing more and more and I started getting really stressed. Then when I had a break down and started slipping back he took said some shit to me which really cut me deep. I stopped talking to him for a while after that. He said things that confirmed what I thought people in my family were thinking abou me. Now the issue I'm facing. I don't feel justified in being angry at him because he was trying to help and he just got too excited at seeing progress that I had made many times before and then he got frustrated when it came to a halt. So now I just feel guilty at having the feelings and the anger turns inward and eats me up. But the anger and hurt don't go away from what he said either. It's been months and I just don't want to talk to or see him at all. He's reaching out again and I can't find the words to explain the anger and hurt I feel, because I feel like I shouldn't be angry or hurt. So it's just a big spiral of anger and shame. The worst part is I don't know of I can ever have the same relationship I had with him before. We were buddies. Even if I get over this I just don't know if the trust will ever be back. This makes me sad. I didn't really want him involved, but good intentions make it hard to tell people their help isn't wanted.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Sad all the time and abusing many drugs to try n stay alive Hi, I've had depression n anxiety for a few years now, had ups n downs but mainly downs, it's got to the point where I use weed, md, xans, ket n alcohol to fill up the holes. I honestly wouldn't be alive without the drugs pulling me through, I've even started using my prescription pregabalin (lyrica) to get a buzz too ( taking enough to get high) I barely talk about my feelings I feel so isolated from my friends and the mask is slipping, i want it to slip in a way so they see the real me. I've been trying to open up more but it's so fucking hard to do that, I've got to the point where I don't care, don't care about my life or feelings I don't care how I die, I don't care how long it takes I don't care what method , hanging , OD, drowning, train, fire it doesn't bother me. I don't want to be me anymore I don't want my life, I know that life is shit and throws stuff at you but I can't handle it, my anxiety is so bad I don't open the front door or answer phone calls even if it's my friend. Myself and my mental illnesses have put me in a deep hole and I can't get out by myself, the thing is it's not just me I have many mental health professionals helping me but the thing is I've got used to keeping the mask on, white lies, they don't know the full extent of my problems.

"Post: Friend threatened to ruin my therapists life over a joke. OK so I had a bit of a blur of boundaries with my therapist. It wasn't a big deal. Therapy ended and we became kind of distant friends who still chat via phone calls and texting. However I told my friend that my therapist fancied me etc whilst things were happening. I told her to promise to keep it a secret even if I died. Nothing happened between me and my therapist and we never slept together, but things were a bit... Weird i guess. Some of the stuff my therapist said could make her lose her job. Anyway I pranked my friend today by photoshopping a fake conversation between me and my college tutor. In the convo I told them my friend referred to him as ""daddy nick"" behind his back. It was merely a joke and I didn't really message the tutor any of this. She freaked out when I sent her the photoshopped convo. And her immediate response was: ""I'm going to ruin your therapists life for this!"" I told her it was a joke and a prank. She demanded evidence which i gave her... She then acted as though things were fine when they weren't. She said if I ever do anything like that again she'll ruin my therapists life. I feel as though she is basically at this point a bomb waiting to go off. She then asked me how my rabbit is doing??? Like I want to speak to her now??? Am I doing the right thing for wanting to ignore her and even removing her from my life?",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Help - unplanned pregnancy at 41, wife wants to keep it Hello, I need some real advice. My wife and I were married in 2011. We dated four years and the day we married was the best day of my life. We immediately became pregnant with our daughter, who is now 5. A couple of years later we welcomed our son (now almost 3). Brief introduction of us - I'm almost 41 and she almost 37. I work full time and she recently became a stay at home mom. We are middle class, homeowners living in Seattle, college degrees, financially responsible, socially liberal on most issues, have good friend circle (many with similar aged children), good family support live in area. Both of us raised in healthy and happy traditional nuclear homes. Our traditional marriage is good and based on trust, but I won't lie and say the last 5 years of raising two children hasn't been without its challenges and occasional spat. But we married for life, and at the altar when I said I do forever, I meant it. Overall, we are fortunate and thankful for our lives. After the birth of our second child, I was done. I had considered getting a vasectomy (snipped). Many of my dad friends had done it and recommended I do it. My wife was against it, and I wasn't really wanting to do it either for other reasons. My wife always semi-joked she wanted another kid, and had quipped she felt incomplete and that being a mother is her calling. She is an excellent, patient mother to our children. However, I felt it was a phase and she could get her ""baby fix"" with friends newborns. I did not feel a need to have another child, and was quite against it. I was frank with her on the matter, but because of the differing opinion and emotional confrontation, we avoided discussing it at length. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago when my wife informs me she missed her period and sure she is pregnant. No visits to the doctor yet to confirm, but we have never had problems conceiving, and I believe she is pregnant. Our birth control was her counting her monthly cycle, which she is pretty good at. I always reached for a condom just in case, but she does not like using them and told me it was not needed. Well we slipped one past the goalie. When she told me, I reacted poorly, saying it would mess up the good thing we had going, I was tired and didn't have the energy, our family was complete already. Not to mention the fact that it was be financially very difficult (we'd have to buy a larger house and I don't need to tell you what Seattle real estate is like). We are quite squeezed in our little home already. I told her she would have to go back to work. I asked her to terminate the pregnancy. To sum it up, it wasn't the reaction she was hoping to hear. The next week I bounced between many emotions. Anger, for upsetting our lives, even considering the idea she intentionally got pregnant. Fear, that our stable little family might crumble, that 3 makes an odd man out and the children would suffer. Fear, that she isn't healthy for this, as she is showing some physical ailments/breakdown that shouldn't be ignored and having another child will only fixing those off further. Fear, that I'm suffering physical ailments as well and don't have the energy to go through another round of caring for an infant. Fear, that both her parents and mine are elderly and close to needing care from us, and that they won't be there to be the ""relief valve"" and help with watching the kids when we need it. Anxiousness, that we had just got out of having the kids in diapers and were just starting the ""next phase"" of our children being autonomous and doing activities I could participate in. Guilt, for crushing her dreams and not supporting the idea of a third child when its something she wants very badly. One day I wrote out an objective list of reasons (many of which are cited above) why having a third child was a bad idea. After a few more days of trying to ignore the issue, we had our blowup. I presented her my list and she listened, acknowledging they were valid and made sense. She then countered with her belief that this was meant to be, and she could not in good conscious have an abortion. It would stay with her forever and she says she would never get over it, and would forever resent me for pushing the issue. I told her I might resent the child and her for letting this happen. I slept on the couch that night, feeling disgust and bitterness. The next morning there was nothing else to do but discuss it more. I again said I wasn't interested, and she can't force this on me. She again countered with her same argument that it was meant to be, that our ""next phase"" of children would just have to wait a few more years. I yelled I would be almost 60 years old at this child's high school graduation. I want to play sports with my kids and be active, not the ""old dad"". I said I wouldn't care, not even over the name we would give it. I said I wound't go with her to the doctor appointment. I told her she was being selfish and not putting what she has now over what she might have. She told me she would start contacting a divorce lawyer if this was how it was going to be. It's only been a few days since that talk, but I am completely stunned and not myself. I was a zombie at work, not able to focus on",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I have severe anxiety and suicidal ideation I have no motivation to do anything. If i dont go to work im in bed all day. I have no desire to text friends or do things i used to be passionate about. All i can think about is how much of a loser i am because i haven't applied to any colleges yet (i graduated in may). I see on social media people going out and having fun and i look at myself, im never out of bed. The only time i shower is when i go to work or go run errands with my mom. I am physically and mentally exhausted. Another thing, I have severe anxiety about posting on social media. Ill muster the courage to post a selfie and then delete an hour later. When i have panic attacks i delete my profile picture, bio and everything i posted that is a picture of me or i think people will judge me for. I keep thinking that my friends are just talking about me behind my back and actually hate me. These thoughts get so overwhelming that i start picking at my skin where i think there's something ""wrong"" about it and pulling my hair out. I keep cutting my hair, too. Its only two inches and it used to be down to my elbow. I keep thinking it will be all over if i just walk outside onto the freeway or swallow some pills. The only thing stopping me is that i can't get out of bed most days. I cant handle being myself anymore and i dont know what to do",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Is My Friend A Bad Friend? I have a friend. When I moved to a foreign country, I went to a school and met this friend. We have been quite close but after I moved back to my country, we’ve only been communicating through texts. She has been a helpful friend but I don’t know if she is a good friend or a bad friend. There were many occasions when I wondered if I should break friends with her, but I always told myself that she didn’t mean to ever hurt me and I kept on trying my best to act like nothing was wrong and acted friendly. But I srsly can’t hold it in and I wanna know if I’m just being sensitive.. These are some of the things she does that makes me wonder if we should break friends.. 1.We use eachother’s selfies as our profile pics and I always use the best selfies of hers or at least what I think are the best looking ones. And I sent her a video if me singing with my other friend and she took a screenshot in the middle of the video and used it as her profile pic and My mouth was wide open and my eyes were scrunched up and it really looked horrible and when I asked her to change it, she asked what I meant and that it didnt look bad. Sure she couldve been being nice and I could’ve been acting emotional but I really didn’t like other people who I didn’t even know seeing a photo like this so I pleaded her to change it but I tried to keep the joking and friendly mood. However then she said “Funny. U wouldn’t wanna see the other screenshot I took.” And we both didn’t say anything. And she didn’t change it. 2.The way she texts me depends on her mood. If she isn’t feeling friendly, she barely answers my texts and replies with short answers and doesn’t laugh at anything funny I have to say. I wondered if I could also be acting like that at times but I looked back at our conversations and ai never let my mood change the way I replied to her, and I honestly didn’t even speak in an unfriendly way when she said something rude to me or something that made me feel offended. 3.She doesn’t act like she cares for what I have to say. Whenever something bad happens to me and I tell her, she just gives a small reaction and talks about something else. 4.She ignores my texts. There was once a time when she saw my texts and didnt reply. I asked why she didn’t reply and she saw it but ignored it. I thought that maybe she had something important going on so I just kept on texting her every few hours like nothing was wrong cuz I don’t exactly like showing others when I feel hurt. She read my texts and ignored me for two whole days and finally texted me back as if nothing had happened. She didn’t apologize for not replying nor did she give an explanation. She just texted me about something else she wanted to say. There were lots of cases like this. 5.She acts like she has the worst life. I go through alot of stress each day cuz I have had family troubles and sometimes had been bullied. I have also often had suicidal thoughts. However whenever I tell her about things that are stressing me out, she points out that her life is worse. I understand that she has her own troubles but I really dont like the way she underestimates my life and doesn’t care for it. 6.She once cyber bullied me. When I left her school and left the country, we had a small fight and she told her friends about the bad things I had once said, not mentioning her faults. She then invited me to a group chat with lots of people and they all fought against me, calling me fat,ugly,short,stupid,and dumb. They also made racial comments and insulted my mom. After a year passed, I texted her. I can’t believe I did it, but I said that I WAS SORRY. And she said that she forgave me and now we’re talking like friends again. But whenever I bring up a little detail from the past, she gets mad and says that I am blaming her for the past and makes me feel guilty for something I shouldn’t be guilty about. 7.She thinks that she is perfectly innocent. I’m not saying shes a totally horrible person, she can be a good friend at times, but I gotta admit that at times she can be horrid.. And whenever something bad happens to her, she says that she doesn’t get what she did to deserve it and that she is getting mistreated. If you think about it that way, I feel like I also deserve this, considering Im not a saint or an angel. But whenever my friend says that she didnt do anything bad to deserve some bad things that happened to her, I can’t help but feel disappointed at the fact that she doesn’t realize how much she hurted me What should I do..? Am I just being sensitive..?",reddit_train.csv

There is no monetary exchange only one of friendship and kindness. I would like to document our meeting with a few candid photos only if you are comfortable, if not, a conversation does the trick! Getting to Know a Stranger is all inclusive and strives to get to know all walks of life. I welcome all ages, gender identities, races, religious views, economic status.…. you know every type of Human! I know that in my own life I have felt extremely alone and isolated in my own mind many times, and have felt that there is NO one who understands what I am going through. What I started to notice was through my own travels and tribulations I have noticed one thing, we are all a lot a alike, and most of the time share a more relatable story then anyone in my inner circle. In todays technology the human interaction is becoming less and less human and more and more digitized. Screen watching instead of people watching, direct messaging instead of a hand written letter are methods of detachment driving a wedge between our true selves and the human being sitting across from us. So how do I make a change in my own life toward fighting this black hole of being digitally programmed, force fed fear, and made too wallow in my insecurities. Get out there and meet people of walks of life and commit an hour of my time each day to an individual who could use a human interaction. A little about me! My name is Aaron Bistrin I am a 28 year old guy from Santa Cruz California, a beautiful place to grow up. However it wasn't always easy growing, Santa Cruz can be a tricky place to navigate as youth and I found myself in quite a bit of trouble very young. This continued into my early 20’s and after a series of life changing events I started to make some serious changes in my life. As one positive lead to another, I found myself opening a restaurant in my home town at the age of 25. Fast forward a few years and I have found myself out of the restaurant industry and creating an alternative marketing company with my best friend. This is where I found my love for photography and content creation. My passion for human interaction and learning about people has been inherit nature since I was a child. I feel when meeting strangers our filters are down, there are no pre programmed family/community paradigms, is this not the best opportunity to be your true self? So what better than combine my two passions of photography and human interaction into a Human Thesis with a Photography Minor. Getting to Know a Stranger. If you or someone you know could use a kind interaction by Getting to Know a Stranger, please comment below or shoot me an email at abistrin@yahoo.com.

I always envied just about everyone else and thought the worst about myself and every action I took. The only time I *ever* felt happy about myself was after a psilocybin mushroom trip.

It's not some bullshit fleeting feeling that I get that leads to disappointment.

"Post: Today is my 21st birthday. I'm spending it alone with a bottle of wine. Birthdays have always been a bit of a sore spot for me. To quote a very old comment of mine, ""13th birthday: I had just been let out of a mental hospital a few days before. My mother finds out she has a brain tumor. My only friend at the time gets sick and goes home early. 14th birthday: All my friends but one bail on me. My parents scream at each other until my mother packs up and leaves. 16th birthday: My family and I go out to dinner to a restaurant that my dad chose solely because he had a coupon for it and buys the world's smallest birthday cake. Halfway through my birthday celebration the following weekend my friends abandon me due some drama bullshit that was apparently more important than me. 17th birthday : Dad starts an argument in the middle of a restaurant in front of my best friend. After we get home, the argument continues, resulting in my dad physically attacking my mother. All while my friend and I sat in my bedroom."" To add to that, my friend's mother died of a heart attack on my 18th birthday, and I spent my 20th alone due to the fact that all of my old high school friends had moved on and my best friend had decided to join the military. Well, today was my 21st. My best and only friend completely forgot about me. My dad then made me have an emotional meltdown. Now it is nearly midnight and my only company is the nearly empty bottle of wine sitting next to me, so I am not only sad, but also slightly drunk. Happy birthday to me.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Painfully lonely and spiraling into the worst depression I've ever been in I recently moved to a new city for a job after college. I have a few friends at work, but they're a group of guys that I don't have a lot in common with and we don't really talk outside of the occasional work conversation. They're nice and I'm happy to be friends with them, but it's hard for me to really get to know them because they do ""guy stuff"" on the weekends (like sitting around drinking and playing FIFA) that I'm totally not interested in/they don't bother inviting me to. Other than that, I have a few online friends that I'm growing increasingly dependent on for social interaction which is really unhealthy. I notice myself getting more paranoid with them about not responding, and I bug them way too much to the point where I know I would definitely be annoyed if I was them. Also they're not very supportive (probably the opposite) but it's not their fault -- they're just causal online friends that shouldn't have to cater to my current host of mental problems. I'm totally alone. My family and college friends live 4 hours away. I have pretty bad social anxiety and I'm terrified of every new social interaction I have. I work 9 hours and come home to my empty apartment and watch netflix to escape my own life, every day. I sometimes hear from my college friends about all of the fun they're still having together and it honestly brings me to tears that I have such a pathetic lonely life now. I've never been able to have a ""normal"" social life -- it takes me forever to make close friends, and then even at my best I only have a handful of good friends at a time. I don't enjoy going out every weekend or the other obvious ways of making friends, and that wouldn't work now anyway since I would NEVER go alone and I don't have a single person that I could ask to go with me. When I was a freshman in college I had this same problem -- absolutely zero friends and living in a totally different city. It was the worst depression I've ever been through. I had dozens and dozens of online friends at the time (now we've all lost touch and moved on from the RPG we were playing) that helped ease the loneliness, and I eventually joined a student club and finally made friends after like a year of going. There's not really anything I can ""join"" like that in a non-college town... I've been applying for a few volunteering things, they haven't started but I'm doubtful that it will be a good way to meet people. I honestly just need ONE person to talk to. Anyone. I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm not a complete weirdo or anything and I know I can have meaningful friendships (just 90% of them have been online, and now I can't even seem to make any fucking online friends either), but I live the loneliest life of anyone I've ever known or heard of. I've never been serious about suicide, but recently that's changed and it's becoming something I could actually picture myself doing. I'm a long way from that but at this point I don't see anything getting better and I practically cry myself to sleep some days and have to hide emotional breakdowns at work after eating lunch alone. Does anyone have any advice for meeting new people in a non-college town? Anyone else having the same problem? I'm so lost and sad and pathetic",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Sick and tired of my family and my sister's fiance So what I'm about to share is a very, very long story so I'll try to shorten it without leaving out too much info for better context of the situation. My fiance, we've been together for 3 years, is currently in basic training. There were a few rough patches before he left, partly due to the fact that he wanted to get married before leaving. I love him to death and I know he wanted to get married to get the benefits started but I didn't want to base our marriage off of benefits. I know it won't be and I know he wants to do his best to help us. When I asked why he joined, he said one of the main reasons is to provide more for us and to take care of me, which I'm grateful for but I never wanted him to feel like it was all on his shoulders. That's why we planned to move out towards the end of the year and why I'm on college, to be independent, have stability and create my identity. Now for background info, my fiance and I have been living with my sister and her fiance along with our younger brother; our brother has Autism. Our mother lost the house due to her opioid addiction and we found a place for us to rent together. Our dad left the state the summer before my senior year of high school. So as always my sister and i pick up the pieces and make sure our brother is taken care of. We all have been living together for almost 3 years. Since we've moved into our most recent house, it has been a shit show. 100% of the drama that occurs in the house is due to her fiances family and they don't even live or pay any bills here! Surprisingly after a year of being here they've calmed down but my fiance and I are tired of it. Also I need the ability to live my life and grow as an individual. Having to hold back and set aside my needs and wants is getting tiresome. I barely even want to have children of my own because ive been a parent to my own brother. I don't feel comfortable where I'm at now, I feel like I'm only here because it is convenient, I don't feel appreciated at all. I know my sister wants to keep the family together, or what little we have left but I need room to breathe. Also when I was 16 her fiance offered oral sex to me, I know I should have told her but I also knew she wouldn't have believed me especially given that he is her first everything. I still feel uncomfortable around him at times. My sister cares and trys her best. She wants to buy a house and move down to Texas, that's where we used to live before pcsing to Washington state. I understand the position she was put in, we both had to endure the chaos that was our family these last few years, well since I was in the 8th grade really. However, her goals and mine don't align and I don't feel like compromising those for anyone else anymore. My fiance and I just want some peace and the ability to deal with our own problems, in peace without hearing people argue in the next room. We had a plan to move out towards the end of the year but he didn't want to wait. He was even going to school, he had started his first quarter. I asked him to consider the reserves because he could go to school and when he's done move on to active duty but with him being so stubborn he went active. It's not that I never wanted him to join, my father served 22 years and I want to join as well. I'll support him for however long his career will be but now I'm trying to figure out how do I move on and start my own family. Not that it'll include children right away, but just my fiance and I. When we get married he will be my priority and my family as well, I just don't want my sister thinking I've chosen him over them. But also I need to make decisions for myself. Just about every decision I've made has always needed me to make sure I'm available for other people. I'm tired of always being available. My sister sometimes acts as if she takes care of our brother on her own but that is far from the truth. We've both had to do the same and yet I don't think she really appreciates it, at least she won't until I move with my fiance. I'm not sure if many of you are familiar with this term but enmeshment is the term I'd use to describe my family. There is no boundaries and if you deviate from their mean then you're an oddball. I know I said I'd try to keep it short and this isn't even half of it. I want and going to move with my fiance after I've graduated and we are married. He's getting deployed after OSUT, so I'm thinking it'll be best to get married after and itll keep some stress away from having to worry about doing before he leaves. I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read this, advice is greatly appreciated.",reddit_train.csv

There are days where I just want to play games and sleep all day because that probably is the only way to keep me bloody sane. Then there are days where I completely fine, but I don't think I have the same fire in me when I was younger. Recent mistakes (Failing in my university units, failing to find a job, failure in relationship) are making me nihilistic, self loathing and just feeling really pathetic.

Whenever he can he always speaks to his other friends, let's call him ""Mark,"" Mark doesn't like conflict and therefore listens to everyone. I am his secondary option. 2) Whenever I do better than him at something he always tries to make himself seem better and that I just got lucky. He says things like: ""You just used 10 more minutes, so you did worse"" ""You always get lower or equal to the mark I get."" 3) he tries to get me to adapt to him by saying things like: ""Did you really choose that haircut? Its bad"" Or ""I am dissapointed in you"" And ""We're soul-friends"" (trying to make me agree with him) 4) He is always butting into conversations with my other friends, trying to pull me away from them 5) He tries to convince me that I'll do better at life with him rather than anyone else.

"Post: Feeling Trapped Hello, I am 22 and had quite severe depression during the age of 17-18. My past 3 years of life from the ages 19-22 have actually been great and I have had no problems. I have had a girlfriend since the age of 20 whom I love. I have worked a few different mundane jobs, and have been going to school for electrical engineering. I am entering my last year of undergraduate school in the ASU online program. The reason my depression has returned is because I feel trapped, mainly due to my living situation. I would consider my upbringing to be the low end of middle class, and yes I realize there are people much worse off than I am. I grew up in a family of 6, 2 parents and 4 siblings including myself. For the past 18 years we have lived in an 1800 sq. ft. town house in California, right off of a busy street. There are 2 rooms in the house. The master bedroom is rather large, I would estimate about 2.5x as big as the other bedroom. Up until a few months ago when my sister moved out, all 4 of us siblings were sharing the smaller room. Now there are 3 of use sharing it, but still two bunk beds taking up the same space. There is absolutely no space, and I am 6'3"" tall and do not really fit into my twin size bunk bed. My mom has kept the large master bedroom for herself over the years, and has forced my father to sleep in the living room, despite the fact that he is the one who pays the bills. She is a selfish person. My desk, which is where I try to study and work, and where I spend most of my time, is in the living room. My dad is usually in the living room watching TV, and there are lots of noise and distractions from other people and the kitchen etc. which make it nearly impossible to study or just relax. This didn't really bother me much as a kid, but now that I am 22, it is getting worse and worse everyday. Because I do online schooling (which was not what I intended) , I have little to no interaction with peers and my schooling is basically sitting in front of my computer at home. I feel completely trapped. The bedroom I share is completely cramped, and usually one of my other siblings is in it. In the living room I am surrounded by distractions and other people, with absolutely no privacy. It is hard to study or focus on anything. I feel like I have no space to myself, like there is nowhere to go. I often feel extremely anxious and depressed, and feel as though someone is cramming me into a box. This makes me just want to cease being conscious. All I think about is how badly I need to move out. Every night it is getting worse and worse, until I decided to come here tonight to post. Due to school payments, and buying a car, it is not possible to move out with the mediocre job that I have. There is still another year until I graduate school, and even then I don't know for certain if I will be able to get a job that will enable me to move out. I will still have to pay off school loans after that. The thought of staying here for another year, or even worse 2-3 years is completely unbearable. My girlfriend and I have made plans to move out together eventually, but that probably wouldn't happen for another 2 years minimum. This had made me extremely depressed and anxious the past 6 months. Does anyone have any advice for what I should do? I have been considering spending more time at libraries during the day. I have also been trying to spend a little more time outside and at the gym etc. But if anyone else has been in a similar situation, please give me advice. Note: I know there are people who have it much worse. Homeless, disabled, etc. I realize that and that is the main thing that I try to think about when I feel depressed and anxious. That I have it better than some people. But this is just my personal situation I am trying to deal with.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: I used to know exactly what I wanted to do in life, but now when I look foreword all I see is eventual suicide. My whole life I’ve wanted to go enroll in Animal Studies at NYU to eventually get a degree in zoology. It’s been my dream for as long as I remember. I was going to get good grades, get my driver’s license at 16, stay in shape, eat healthy, get married, have kids, earn enough scholarships that most of my college was paid for, and get a job that I loved. Basically be the perfect woman. But now, everything seems so impossible. I’m currently failing most of my classes because I can’t find the motivation to do assignments, which causes anxiety to wrack up even more than usual. It’s just been awful. Anyways, when I try to look foreword once again that my young, stupid self had planned out when she was little, all I can see is... nothing. I just want to be clear that the only reason I’m still on this earth is that I know suicide would crush my family. I want help, I really do, but my pride won’t let me ask. And even though I (temporarily) decided to live, the call of the peace after death still calls out to me.

"Post: A song of fire and ice Hey everyone. I'm on mobile so pardon my typos which will happen. I'd like to take this time to thank anyone who reads this as well as giving a shout out to anyone currently struggling with depression. I have a long history with Type 1 Bipolar Disorder. Although that isn't necessarily depression in itself patients who are Bipolar are bound to eventually oscillate into that emotional polarity. To give a quick summary here is what happened to me: I grew up incredibly wealthy. My Father was an ex alcoholic. My Mother died when I was 13 and my Father went back to drinking to cope with the loss of his wife (my Mother). My Father became suicidal and threw everything we had away. We went bankrupt and I went to live with my Brother across the country. My Brothers wife left him shortly after I moved in. He became suicidal as well, ended up hospitalized. I moved back across the country again to live with my then pseudo homeless Father. One day my Father shows up to my school drunk, gets arrested, I am taken in by the state and put into foster care. I end up living with an incredibly poor hispanic family and eat almost nothing everyday. I have no bed. I sleep on the floor. The state then places me in an incredibly religious home where i essentially become a slave and i cook and clean nonstop for an extremely wealthy catholic couple. They don't like me Because I liked hard rock. My third stay I end up living in a small apartment with a woman who was good at hiding her side prostitution gig and methamphetamine addiction. After all the years my Father gets his life back under control. He begins dating a wealthy woman who isn't a fan of me. He takes prolonged stays at her home about 40 miles away. He would visit the house to restock it with food, pay the bills, then leave again. During this time i saw my Father maybe 15 times a year. Each encounter was brief and lasted less than 30 minutes. During this I still went to school, cooked, did my laundry, and did kind of normal kid stuff. The point of this story is I am an adult now who is married. I am a software engineer. I am financially stable. Regardless of how dark it gets it is possible to make it out on top. You have to focus and be strong. Do whatever you need to do to survive. If anyone has any questions or would like to chat, need advice, whatever please let me know. I currently do volunteer work to aid people who suffer from Bipolar Disorder as well as others like ADHD or OCD. I also, accidentally, mentor Fatherless children on Xbox Live (strange, I know). Its not easy out there and world and parents sometimes forget how hard it is being a teen. No judgement. I hope everyone has a good night (or day, depending where you're at).",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Is this my distorted reality? Okay, I almost always run into this problem with friends, and I'm not sure how to get out of the situation without feeling guilty or ashamed of losing yet another friend. Situation One There's this friend whom I helped many times and every single time other people bashed me, she would either laughed with other people or further ridicule me. Things like asking me to fix her phone, helping her find a place to rent, providing her with advice on many issues... I have since asked her not to further ridicule me, and her response was, ""oh this is not what I do, but I would like to remain friends with you because you are a resourceful person and you see things differently."" I kind of ghosted her after I graduated from university, but I always wondered whether I handled the situation appropriately. She always tries to avoid me in public space, but when she gets into a car accident, she would call me and ask for help. I am neither interested nor in love with her. I actually felt she might be in a hopeless state, that's why she wanted my help. SCENARIO TWO I have this friend who always makes weird implication towards how stingy I am. They made assumptions about my contributions to me and my SO and said things like, ""Oh, if given the opportunity, would you kill [so's name] and claim his insurance policy"", ""You know greedy people normally turn out to be the poorest bunch in the population right?"". The fact is, I have been contributing to the relationship between my SO, my SO is older than me, so in a way, my SO is more financially independent. At times when SO is helping me out, I always mark the number down so I know how much I owe SO [actually he calculated the amount and sends me invoices]. But I won't disclose such details to my friends. I am just disappointed as to how people assume things and the last thing I want is to be the victim in every f*ing relationship. Is there something I am not seeing here, is there a problem with how I am handling the situation well?",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I began to openly discuss my depression to my friends. It was very painful to discuss but I think it's a step in the right direction. Up to now, I have never discussed my depression with anyone besides my husband and my therapist. I have slight PTSD from when I was kid and a teacher had been ""concerned"" for me by some disturbing behavior. I felt even more misunderstood and felt so much anguish that I became really good at disguising my depression. I hid it under a fake, likable, version of myself because I wanted to fit in and feel like I belong. Currently, my closest friends are my coworkers but they the most judgmental people I've known. We became close by commiserating together at work. Fast forward a few years, I am finally starting to feel better after seeking help for my depression. I've been seeing a therapist for over a year, began taking antidepressants two months ago, and have been taking cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. As I begin to feel better, I also feel more miserable hanging out with my friends. I decided to be more open with the people around me about my depression. I revealed it today for the first time with one of my closest friends. It was incredibly scary for me... I haven't felt this vulnerable in a long time. My friends typically see me as a guarded person with a hard exterior, but I felt tears welling in my eyes. He was very surprised to hear, but I'm not the first person he knows with depression so it was reassuring to know he didn't think I was some sort of freak. He also commended me for taking steps in getting better and encouraged me to continue talking about it. It was a positive experience overall. I then decided to tell another friend later in the day because I was feeling good after the discussion I had earlier. It went a little differently though... His first question was, ""what do you have to be depressed about?!"" which instantly flooded my mind with negative feelings of remorse. I tried my best to keep calm and answer his questions honestly. I explained that it's not any thing or anyone that is making me *feel* depressed. It's a mental condition I have which causes me to be in a persistent state of sadness and worthlessness. He asked me if I understand where Eric is coming from (his bipolar nephew that he sometimes mentions), and I said yes. He then seemed to become more curious and asked me many questions about what it's like. In the end, I feel like I educated him on depression and hopefully helped debunk his belief that depression is just a feeling that people should be able to snap out of. I honestly don't think I could have these conversations if I was in the state I was even a month ago. Even today, I felt myself slipping into the familiar downward spiral. I don't know what kept me composed today, but I'm so proud of myself for making it through the conversation without snapping or becoming defensive. Perhaps if I had these conversations in reverse order, it could've been a completely different experience. I hope this inspires others to talk about it, seek help and be open to receiving it. It was quite uncomfortable but I am happy to create an opening for other people to understand what we are going through.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Hello out there.... Ugh. I battle with depression, anxiety, bulimia, OCPD, BPD, and some physical health issues. Not so sure about battle right now. Maybe more like grudgingly coexist with? I'm 42. I've never held a job with the same company for longer than 3 years, and that was just once. A few times (I think) I've made it to the 2 year mark with a company. 1 year is a bit easier. I had to quit my last job because it was too easy to use the job to fuel the eating disorder. (I lost 40% of my starting weight in about 7 months, before I switched phases and ended up with a pulmonary embolism from refeeding syndrome.) Right now I'm in the initial hurry up and deny me so I can get an attorney phase of applying for disability. Thankfully I have a sister who is letting me live in her house, so at least I'm not homeless. (TBH, most of the time she's out of the country, and when she is here, she's just as selectively social as I am.) Because of waiting to get on disability, I'm off my medicine. I can't even afford the cheapest ACA insurance, and even if I had that, I couldn't afford the copays for my medicine. I'm not eligible for Medicaid in my state until I get approved for SSI/SSDI. I'm not too worried about not having my antidepressants right now tho. This is probably the most pleasant major depressive episode I've ever had. It's not so much feeling horrible psychic pain as it's just been a gentle bleeding out of the vibrancy of life. I sleep as late as I can every day, (usually until around 1 or so), hang out in bed playing games, reading, or watching videos, and only really waking up and being willing to be awake around 7 in the evening. I don't feel like I'm living anymore. I'm just in a holding pattern. I think back to what my life was like, even 8 months ago, and I mourn for it. At least I'm not suicidal. I think I just need a place where I can come every so often and unload my mind. Thanks for sticking around to the end of the post.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I lost my father recently, and now I have less suicidal thoughts This isn't gonna be what you think it's gonna be. If you read the title you're probably thinking my father was the reason of my issues. He was not, I loved him very dearly. I am extremely sad he passed away while I'm in such a young age (I'm 21) but c'est la vie I guess.. The reason I'm now less likely to commit suicide is actually I won't / can't do this to my mother. We had to plan and pay for the funereal and oh my days it's expensive. Already we were on the line of poverty, and this didn't quite help. I just can't do it to my mother to spend even more money that she doesn't really have. So now the feeling of guilt 'if' I were to do it is bigger than my misery. Now I just slate the days away, it's hard, but there's no other option for me right now..",reddit_train.csv
Post: My roommate asked me move. My car died. And I put myself in the hospital. Girlfriend is over it and wants me to get my life together. With out without her. She doesn't want to be around me. I'm ubering to my job at the moment. I just basically shut down at the start of sundown. Shut down and drank for 4 or 5 days with the last one with me on the phone with a rope on my neck. I feel absolutely help less. Don't have money to pay rent. Don't have enough money to Uber to work. My next logical step is to move back to my mother's. Which is not only depressing. She's just 40 minutes from everything. I'm not even thinking suicide. I'm just thinking like life pretty much has a depressed shade over it. Probably from me recovering from withdrawal. I don't want to move back to my mom's. To sit there away from everything I want to do. And now I gotta start over. Fuck this is why I drank. the panick begins to consume me.,reddit_train.csv

"Post: Should I let my brother live with us? Not sure if this is the right place or if another sub is better, but here goes. I have a brother, 29, turning 30 this year, who lives with my parents. My parents sold their house and have not yet decided where to live. They are 65 and 70 and are retired. We own a small apartment building and live in it and rent the units. My parents will have some cash and also have monthly income, but my brother appears to be very depressed, may also have some untreated medical issues, and is a sober alcoholic who may be abusing prescription drugs (not pain pills, but Xanax &amp; Ativan? Not sure). He seems to sleep all day and rarely goes to his job, which is doing over other people's houses as a contractor. He owns his own truck and tools. My parents are worried they'll ""lose"" him when they move if he doesn't move with them, but nobody knows what to do or what his real problem(s) are. Is it a stupid idea for us to just have everyone live in our building and subsidize my brother's ""rent"" by having him pay some nominal amount subject to regular psychiatry and/or other requirements? Has anyone done this? Is there another sub that is better for these types of questions? I don't know if anyone knows what to do anymore. My mom enables him but is finally making an appointment for him to see an internist, though he is very manipulative and secretive so I don't know what to do or if anything else can be done and I am somewhat concerned he will manipulate the internist--he's very deceptive. I don't even know if there's a name for what he does.",reddit_train.csv

"Post: I lost my closest So recently one of my biggest fears came true. I don’t have many friends and that’s because I always feared that a friend would know me and just completely hate me. So I only had like two or three friends for this reason. Then I was diagnosed with depression, so I tried to tell my best friend at the time that I had depression and that over the last year or so that may be why I had done some weird drastic things (in this time I never did anything to harm my friend emotionally or physically). While I was telling him he became hostile towards me and then told who told his girlfriend who in turn became hostile towards me and told me I was a shit person (A shit father and a shit boyfriend). That was 3 months ago. So I stopped talking to them because of that I tried going to my closest friend about something I never talked about ever to anyone and it caused them to walk away. Then I sought out help and I started to recover from the issue the and I made regular updates about on Facebook because I was finally ready to talk about my issue, but one day when I said I lost a friend him and the other person I thought was my friend attacked me in the comments because I made a side comment about what happened between us. I never mentioned names. I tried to move on with my life but they were the only friends I really had and I so completely distraught because I don’t know what to do or honestly really how to make new friends. I feel like now since it has finally happened to me I can deal with people who I thought were friends turning their backs on me but I just don’t know how to make friends. Can I get some advice on what to do. Also I’m a 22 year old guy with a baby and a happy relationship. Do I even need friends?",reddit_train.csv

Sadly, I’m in such a deep depressive episode that I can’t enjoy it, it feels more like background music, I just can’t enjoy it. I’m also anxious, I don’t really know why.

"Post: I've been in a constant rush to try and get on my feet for the last three years, but I always end up doing nothing about it. I've forgotten what motivation is all about. Hey there, I just turned 22. And this is my situation: About three years ago, I used to feel excited about everything. Finishing school, starting my studies at a university, being self-sufficient, finally doing what I thought was my future career. I'm not sure what happened, but I started losing my drive. Things didn't look as exciting, nor entertaining. Never having even kissed a girl, I felt alone and loveless. Still, I felt motivated enough to start working on my social skills, met a few people over the Internet, even got a girlfriend. (Thanks to the Internet I have a social life, as ironic as that sounds, even though it's not that good). Fast forward to this year, I was able to date a couple more girls, had a good time but they all ended too soon. I've never been able to have sex with the girls I've been with because I lost my sex drive in the course of these last years. Also the extremely low self esteem and self hatred don't help. Today, I find myself unable to even have a conversation with someone, mostly girls. I can't come up with anything to talk about and I feel like all the things I learned about social skills have gone away suddenly. How do people have such natural conversations with one another? How did I manage to do it before? I feel like I want new friends, I want to have a good time, but can't figure out where to go, or what to do to achieve that. Regarding my studies, this year was a slow one. In the time I should have completed 50% of my career, I only completed around 20%. I started visiting a psychologist because I can't get myself to study for my exams (I'm not cooperating much with him), and all I do is worry about it though I never take up the responsibility. I am fully aware of the fact that things don't come if you just sit and wait, but I can't bring myself to do anything other than complain. Meanwhile I feel like my mind wants to run, but doesn't know which way to go, and my body won't budge. I think 24/7 about how I'm getting older, and I'm wasting every second of my life. I'm completely lost and feel like everything I do is going nowhere. And I don't even know how to end this post, just wanted to put this somewhere and hopefully get some solutions or words of encouragement from people who've been through the same. Sorry for the long read.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: I sob thinking about my painfully wasted young years I'm going to write this hopefully without stopping to think myself into madness with corrections and such. Too late I just backspaced two whole sentences! There is this big fucking hard block of concrete in my head that stops me from doing anything including things I like such as drawing and reading. I love going on tumblr and pinterest and deviantart to look at the amazing drawings and paintings people are able to create. Sometimes though, I get really jealous of the fictional characters in the fandoms. Heck, I get really jealous of people in my life and around the world; young people. I just get this sinking, dreadful feeling inside my chest realizing that I'm wasting my young years doing nothing. I'm 24 now, and looking back on my life I've just been a sad, pathetic underachiever with no drive or history of doing anything adventurous. I'm wasting my young years. I'm wasting my young years. It plays over in my head all the time. I can't get my brain to shut off. Every night before I go to bed it plays over and over. I'm just so sad and disappointed in my life and how I've done nothing with it. Even as a little kid I never did anything fun and I don't have any wild stories of adventure, excitement, nor things like ""Lol we were dumb kids yada yada...We did this all the time yada yada..."" I'm sorry for the rant. Writing it out didn't help me get the chants out of my head. I'm so sad guys. And I know that fictional characters are deliberately made to be fascinating and have amazing lives, but there are people who were born 5 years before me (who are real, yes) and they are really living their lives to the fullest and are doing amazing things. Right now I want to go out, rent a solid 4x4, and drive to some god knows where designated dark space and lay on my back and gaze at the stars in the night sky. I want to go do something fun and amazing, but knowing I've wasted so many years being depressed in bed, on my computer, sleeping, and just doing nothing will haunt me forever.

"Post: How to disown my sister How do I remove my 18 year old sister from the family? I’m her younger brother (16) and all my life my sister has been nothing but manipulative towards my parents. The main issue is when she turns my mom and Dad against each other, resulting in her being free to do whatever while our parents scream at each other, leading to my mom crying or then separating for a few days. This isn’t the first time it’s happened, which is why I’m taking into serious consideration of kicking her out of our family. I understand my sister means a lot to me so it won’t be easy but her behavior have made my mom cry more times than I can count. Unfortunately, my parents are also very soft on her so they will not go along with me trying to disown her. I understand some people might think I’m a terrible person but I have lost a lot of respect for my sister where this seems to be the only Option. I appreciate all advice :)",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Feeling numb I’ve realized that if I can’t talk to someone about my feelings then the next best thing is to write them down and seek advice from reddit so here I am. I’m on campus right now preparing for my midterm and my confidence is at an all time low. I haven’t even seen the paper and already I feel as if I’ve lost. I never thought I would reach such a low in my life. Something weird happened today. I finally set up a countdown timer to the day my exam results are announced. That seemed like the next logical step and it made complete sense to me in a weird way. The only thing that made me remove that was talking to my parents and seeing the hope and love for me in their eyes. I know my life isn’t truly mine and that if I hurt myself then I also hurt other people but it’s just getting too much. The thought is always there in my mind and for the past few days that voice has gotten stronger. I’ve been through this period before and had come out nearly unharmed and at the beginning of the year I was feeling optimistic about what’s to come but that lasted all of one month. The future I was dreaming of looks bleak and distant and with every passing minute that future keeps on going farther and farther away from me. I try very hard to keep my guard up near people I know and love but it’s becoming harder and harder to do so. I used to think that I was destined to do some good in the world but maybe that was just me being delusional. It’s getting harder to keep the tears in. Whenever I used to feel numb, I used to punch the wall just to feel something but even that is not helping now. All I wanna do is talk to someone and pour my heart out but I don’t know if I have the strength left to do that. Getting out of bed is starting to feel like a struggle and for the first time in a while I’m afraid of myself, of what I might do if things don’t go my way. I know that this is not the end of the line but why does it feel like it is? How can anyone recover from such a failure? It’s gotten so bad that I would much rather prefer that I disappeared than having to tell my parents what’s wrong. Depression is nothing new for my university and it wouldn’t be the first time that someone took a drastic step and now I know why they did what they did. The pressure and stress which comes with a university as respected as mine, is just too much to handle. I’m almost inclined to reveal my university’s name just in case someone’s able to figure out who I am and I can finally get the respite I desire so much. All around me I see happy faces and I can only hope that one day I can leave all this behind me and be happy but in the meantime I guess I just have to struggle on and wait for the light at the end of the tunnel.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: So depressed that I developed disassociation. So I am going to bed after posting thus so sorry if I don't respond right away. I am 32. My short and sweet backstory is that I lost the love of my life because of alcoholism and depression. The way we broke up was the worst thing to happen to any person. She basically called the police on her way home from work, had me put in jail for a week on false charges and since I moved out of the state I couldn't call my family while I was incarcerated and charges eventually dropped. It broke me so terribly that I literally split personalities. I have the me that stares deep into the darkness all the time and the me that deals with and tries to make sense of the aftermath. Every time that person takes over I feel a part of me being lost. In a way it us insanely scary that depression can eventually turn into this.

You have **zero** assurance that people who act nice and fine when you're around are really nice and fine towards you when your back's turned. I wouldn't have known the true, judgmental, and frankly I have no fucking idea where in the ass of God did they pull all their judgmental shit - if I hadn't snooped and read text messages of my mother to other people. Hell, my own mother's in it, too! ""Hide the knife, he might stab our son (my stepfather)."" ""You're sick, go to a doctor for a checkup. You can't give up, please don't die. We pity your son.

I've confirmed EVERYTIME, that family is my main source of toxicity. FUCK THAT. I'm being ganged up on by everyone in this house, and their relatives, and every single one of my relatives. I once questioned if I was the one at fault. I mean, if EVERYBODY hated you, you're probably doing something wrong. UNLESS, you're just that damn unlucky and every single one of your relative is a fucking asshole. I've heard of those stories before, so it isn't impossible - and I think that's the case with me.

My brain decided this : Instead of sleeping, why don't you become half crazy, thinking about your future (should I say the ""lack"" of future ?). Here, have some cravings for cigarettes, my pleasure, and of course i know you don't have cigarettes, do you think I'm stupid ? The middle of the night is the best moment for thinking of smoking when you can't smoke. Think of your loneliness. Think of you inexistant social life. You are 25 and you have no job. You are living with your boring mother, with whom you literally quarel with every day. She probably think you are a piece of shit. You never had any girlfriend, and you probably won't. Almost 26, don't count on me to congratulate you... Your only sunbeam will be at New year's Eve, when you will travel to see your best friends. But guess what, since you have no money at all, you probably will have to work to sell fu***ng pastries, and because of that you won't be able to see your friends. Then you'll continue to argue with your mother. Living on the couch. Selling pastries. In entire loneliness. God only knows how long. The funny thing (say my brain) is this : ""you are a loser, you lived and worked on your own not so long ago. But you are a child, you have the power to do what you want, where you want. You're 25, for God's sake, so why don't you move your ass ?"" Leave me alone brain, I already know all that. I would be a king if I could. But I won't.

I know it's just a glorified hook up app for the most part but the other night I matched with a really cute girl who was way out of my league and we started talking, one thing leads to another and next thing I know we're up to after 2am talking about Pokémon of all things. I feel like there's a connection there so i ask her out and she says yes. It took alot to do this and it honestly made my month as the last few have been pretty meh.

This morning I said Hi and she replied Hey back and then I asked her what she was up to and she just didn't reply again. I don't blame her if she isn't interested, that's fair enough it happens.

The friend in question and I have been friends for over 7 years and best friends for the last 3 years and have shared just about every detail of our life. I am a very observant person and have seen many repetitions in her behavior over the last years. The heading is a bit misleading here. I am not mad at her that she doesn’t follow my advice. Rather, I am somewhat annoyed that she keeps making the same mistakes with the same toxic people in her life. I have been telling her that many of the people she surrounds herself with are very manipulative and are using her in one way of another as she has actually realized that, however she can’t seem to actually do anything about this and keeps sacrificing her own needs to satisfy those of the people around her. This doesn’t just happen once or twice, but it happens almost on a daily basis and I can basically feel her mental stability deteriorating. I have been telling her for forever that she should focus on her personal growth and leave the toxic people in her life behind. I know that that is super hard to do and super easy to says and that you can’t follow that super easily and I have been trying very hard to be as supportive as I can and listen to her and be a shoulder to cry on. But it’s also very hard to see her being hurt over and over again by the same type of people or even the same person when there is a solution to the problem. And it seems like she isn’t learning and instead she is just getting more and more insecure and anxious and her panic attacks are increasing in frequency because of these people. And it also makes me very anxious when I constantly worry about her. But I don’t want to guilt or manipulate her into any decisions. And I don’t know what to do. help pls im desperate.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Really struggling with self image - any tips to build self confidence? I have struggled with my overall view of myself for as long as I can remember - in particular with my weight. Where im at, at the moment feels like the worst its ever been, I keep having full blown melt downs about how much I repulse myself. Throughout my life Ive been on more diets than I can count and tried multiple different excercise routines. About 4 years ago I gained 30kgs really fast and after moping and feeling sorry for myself i decided i would kick it up a notch and started taking things really serious. 6 days a week at the gym, personal training, strict meal plans - the works. This worked so well at the beginning, I dropped 18kgs in the first few months. It came to a halt and for the past 3 years I've continued to lose weight slower - im at about 25 kilos down in total now. I thought I would be further along by now. I live and work on the road at the moment travelling from town to town so ive dropped the gym membership but I try and make up for it with doing workout sessions on my own, lots of hiking and swimming. I recently switched to a keto diet from the previous meal plan I was on. I am fitter than I have ever been and what I can achieve now in a physical capacity is so much greater than ever before in my life (I was less fit even as a child) The problem I have is that im still so overweight, I very rarely find anything that fits me in stores and i dont have an address to order things online. I feel like people could look at me and assume I dont give a fuck about my health when I do and that makes me feel worse. Anytime I talk to doctors about unrelated issues they make it about my weight. I feel like outwardly im the worst version of myself, I look in the mirror and get angry. Does anyone have any tips on how to pull myself out of this? I feel so crushed when I'm reminded of my weight because I dont feel how I look. I want to be proud of my achievements but I'm not, I feel annoyed that its not better and I havent reached a bigger goal. I think ill never reach a weight I'm happy with - which is not only devastating to me but bothers me so much more because im genuinely trying my hardest. Ive had hiccups and times where I've literally tried to eat my feelings away but I always pick myself up and try again. I dont know how many more times I can fail. In an effort to help me stay on track my partner started eating the same foods as me. Weightloss had never been his goal or something he was focusing on, it was just to make it easier on me not to see him eating a toasted cheese sandwich while I was eating salad with no dressing. He wanted to limit the temptation and helped cook me awesome healthy meals that tasted a million times better than anything I cooked. For him it worked a treat, he was never overweight just a bit stocky, but hes since lost so much weight and looks amazing. And whilst im so happy for him it hurts as it just shows how much progress i havent made. As stupid as it sounds I think it highlights my weight more when we're together cause he looks so fit and healthy and I look like I sit around eating kfc all day. I want to be confident or at least more confident but I'm so critical on myself I cant even begin to let the confidence through. Any thoughts on this are appreciated and thankyou to anyone who took the time to read this.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Long text, I just want an audience. Why haven’t I killed myself yet? It’s not the title, but a question that lingers on the back of my head every second. It’s a common trend that people live for other people but what do you do when you have no one to live for? I never had anyone to live for. It’s not a huge problem really, its another lingering question or jealousy I have whenever I meet a person. Every single one of them have someone who cares for them, even a stranger would care for them. It makes me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation. People don’t care, they pity me. They realize, then, that I’m a hopeless situation and they can’t help me at all because they really can’t. No one can. Therapies don’t help. My therapist knows all of my situations are out of my control and he wants me to move forward with my life. It’s not really a bad idea, it’s the smart thing to do especially being someone in my situation. I just don’t know why I can’t. Every single being on the planet wants me to graduate already but my body doesn’t agree with me. It’s always either I’m too sad/ stressed/ depressed/ ashamed/ anxious/ lazy to go to school. Nothing helps. Not even the 30mg of Lexapro helps. My school counsellor is doing the nice “I get it, I understand” approach with me and it makes me feel better but it really does make me feel guilty. I just don’t understand why are people act so shitty with me? Is it my face? Is it because no one cares and all I have is literally myself? Is it because I’m dying soon? What is it really? I just want to fucking die but I cant just let myself slash my throat or swallow a lot of pills because I’m a coward. I want the easy way out. Why isn’t cancer an instant death? Why aren’t suicide booths similar to futurama a thing? I give up. I just want to die. P.S. Fuck people who say they’re afraid of rejection because hunty what world do u fucking live in that not one single person has said no to you? P.P.S. Fuck you E, I’m sorry I disappointed you that I didn’t die yet even my diagnosis’ average life span is 6 months. Don’t worry, it’s coming. And I surely fucking hope karma is real. It’s fucking people like you who deserve such things and what do you fucking get? A nice family, a handsome face, people who likes to be around you. You’re one of the people who deserve my revenge and yet I’m being like a pussy who is letting a fake thing called “karma” take care of everything. In this fucking lifetime, not a single one got any karma. (or maybe my parents did by god giving me cancer but idk they just labelled me as a liability and now has dropped me like a hot potato so that’s really more on me than on them) PLEAAAAAAAAAAAASE I just want to die. Please just kill me.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Tomorrow the world will go on like always I've never been here... this wasn't a part of ""the plan"" but I said why not leave something somewhere since no one else will be receiving anything. I have lived 20 years by myself, no relationships, no close friends, and the memories of being taken advantage of in my youth haunt me day in and day out. I run away through drugs but my depression is beginning to break through my facade of confidence. No one knows who I am and even if presented with a companion I don't know if I could ever explain the scars. I hate who I am and how I act, I feel though it's not even me. Social anxiety makes me act in ways I can't even understand and the repetition of ""I'm okay"" is getting old. I've tried to make friends but no one seems to want to know me and it's left me feeling like a sociopath. Insanity overcomes me as I scream, clenching a blade that can no longer quiet my mind. I've tried so hard to not be ignorant or selfish but I can't handle this anymore. The need of hospitalizations and psychologists remind me of the freak I am. I strive for perfection but am the opposite of it. I have so much love that I want to express but have no place to put it. I was raised religious but have so many doubts, my problem maybe isn't ignorance but overthinking, I hope... Nobody seems to understand subjectivity/relativity. There is much to be said but this will probably find its own void. I'm dreaming of a different world, but the oblivion of what I don't know plagues me. I leave my love and peace here, may you find yours.

I think she may have only gone in an effort to save our marriage rather than herself. She's gotten new meds and this has happened over about 6mo.

"Post: Apologizing to a family member ? Not sure if this is the right place to put this? If it’s not feel free to direct me! To sum it up, I’ve highly offended a family member of mine. I wrote this apology that I can’t bring myself to send them. I kept telling them how much I wanted to see them and I even flew up to see everyone. When we were all seated at a restaurant I was having really bad anxiety and didn’t really speak to anyone. He took this really personal and felt I came off as an asshole. I didn’t know how to explain the anxiety part of things to him so I gave him a lame excuse about eating spoiled food the night before. While it was true it wasn’t the reason I wasn’t speaking to anyone. Then I had went to his house to try and speak to him as I was leaving the next day and he told me not to come. I did anyway and you can imagine that didn’t end well at all. He won’t talk to me. I finally found the courage to type up this apology. It explains the conditions I suffer from, how they’re debilitating and the trauma I endured that caused them. The apology I feel is oversharing but I also wanted to explain myself in full and be as genuine as I possibly can. Nobody knows the things I went through but I’m going to post the apology here for you guys to read for yourselves. Please don’t judge me too harshly I just don’t want this family member to never talk to me again. I understand it may come off as a pity me type of thing but I promise it’s not. Here it is : I just wanted to let you how sorry I am. I should’ve apologized sooner but I wanted to give you time. I’d like to fully explain myself. This is really long but it’s genuine. And I’m not justifying myself in any way as I fully understand that I’ve crossed boundaries and disrespected you but I also want you to have a better understanding of what really happened. Hear me out before you roll your eyes at what I’m about to say. Some of this won’t make any sense initially. But trust me it all ties together. Whatever decision you make I’d prefer for you not to tell anyone any of this stuff. This is why I handled certain things the way I did. I’ve been through a lot of trauma. Initially it was with Savannah’s dad. He would beat me, kick me, slap, choke, etc told me my mother would be happy with me gone. And she was aware and didn’t do anything. This was when Jody had custody of me but I was visiting them when they had an apartment together. Eventually I went to live with my dad and his parents. His mom didn’t want any more kids and she was absolutely terrible to me. She’d give me Valium to sedate me, swing pots and pans at me, threaten me with knives, lock me out of the house etc. My dad wasn’t any better as he gave me my first black eye. School was really difficult as I’d get bullied pretty bad and I’d get myself suspended just to avoid it. At this point people claimed I had a behavioral issue and I was put on multiple medications I didn’t need. His mom was able to collect SSI because of this and when Jody found this out she wanted me back. After a year back and forth to court she won custody in January 2014. I was 15 at this point. She promised me a better life but it only got worse. She kept me locked up in the house for 4 years as she didn’t want me improving and losing the SSI. Her boyfriend also lived there, he was an alcoholic. He’d break into my room in the middle of the night to beat and rape me. Taunt me about how I’ve made previous suicide attempts and would go on about how he’d kill me but he figured I’d do it myself anyway. I’ve never told anyone as I figured nobody would ever believe me. Anyway, I was diagnosed with depression, PTSD, Panic Disorder, and social anxiety, and yet most people aren’t aware of a lot of the things I’m telling you right now. Because of some of these conditions it’s hard for me to socialize with people for the first time. I wasn’t trying to be distant or cold to you in person but my anxiety makes me seem that way and I’m sorry. It’s something I’m trying to work on. In fact it was so bad at one point I wasn’t even able to eat in a restaurant. I couldn’t open the door if I ordered food. I was constantly living in fear of being injured, killed, judged, any situation I was faced with I’d think of the worst possible scenario. It’s even preventing me from getting a license. Now, when you said I was chatty in text and not in person it really hurt my feelings and I wanted to explain but how do I explain this to somebody? If I just said oh I have anxiety I felt as if it would’ve sounded like bs. And I just felt absolutely terrible and I acted on an impulse and I just ended up disrespecting you and crossed boundaries I never should’ve in the first place and I am so so sorry for that. Some of the things Aunt Connie said to me I took it to heart when I shouldn’t have and it was another contributing factor as to why I had left. The spoiled meat story was true it wasn’t a lie. I ate it around 1 in the morning she didn’t give it to me I wasn’t",reddit_train.csv

"Post: Can/Should I send her a dm? Hi I‘ll start this with some backstory. A friend of mine plays in a band and last weekend I watched them live for the first time, it was pretty small with four other bands and maybe 15 people watched my friends band. Anyway their lead singer is a girl who gave some weird vibes while on stage, but she was also very edgy so maybe it was that. After the concert someone showed me her IG and I thought I‘d follow her. She and approved me and followed back. The first post she made after that was pretty much this summarized: I am having a pretty bad phase of depression right now. I have no motivation, cant take compliments serious, hate everything I do and am overwhelmed with the smallest social interactions (there was more but I‘ll stop here). I personally have been struggling for the past few weeks with similar issues again and thought if it was okay to send her a message along the lines of this or if it would be intrusive: Hey I saw your Post about your depression and can relate a lot to yo. I am a friend of guy and saw you live for the first time in city. I know how shit it feels to have phases like this and won’t say it becomes magically better, but you are doing an amazing job with your music. I know you don’t know me and I don’t know you, but if you want to talk to someone who comprehend what you are feeling, I would gladly do it.

"Post: I've always resented my mom for being emotionally abusive growing up and blamed her for my depression. But I just told her I'm depressed and she responded in the most perfect way. I feel really weird. I'm an adult now (24) and have had crippling depression since childhood. Growing up, I never had emotional support or love. I was called names and my mom took out her relationship/life issues on me. I was distant from both my parents. I've hugged my mom only once in my life. This is just one issue out of many that led to me developing a fragile self esteem and crippling depression. Over the years, with distance, we started to talk- like once a month or so. The more educated I became, the more I came to understand why she acted the way she did (although I still harbor much resentment) I'm going through a depressive episode just now. I feel so alone and I texted her out of desperation. I told her I felt alone and depressed and couldn't get out of bed to study. Instead of judging me or saying something mean....she just listened to everything and all of my symptoms. She said that she felt so sorry for me and she wished she could help me. And she told me to never feel alone because she loves me and I'm very important to her. She asked if she could do anything to help me...and I realized, yeah, if we could call each other every morning, I could have someone to talk to and tell her about my daily goals. Then I could feel more motivated to get out of bed and feel less alone that day. I just feel weird, because I don't have a relationship with her. I'm scared it's going to be awkward, but I'm desperate for any support I can get right now. I also still resent her, but at the same time understand. I don't know. It's just weird. But, I'm happy she acted this way, for sure. Edit: I also don't mean to brag or anything like that. I just wanted to share this with someone, and was wondering if someone had a similar experience maybe in forming a bond with their parents longer into adulthood.",reddit_train.csv
"Post: Best friend of 12 years seems to be drifting When we were in middle/high school we were inseparable. I thought she was the most amazing person to ever walk the planet. She made me feel so smart, beautiful, special, etc...I loved her so much. We went through everything together during those times and when college came around, we went to different schools. I had to work 2 jobs to keep my head above water and couldn't always make the 4-hour drive to see her as often as I wanted. She also got into drugs, which was no issue with me, but since I was never into it, I stopped getting invites to places with her (probably due to the fact I always was ALWAYS working.) We both drifted a bit in college, but then afterward we (and our SO's) moved to the same city. I was so excited to finally have a better schedule and see her as often as I could. I told her how I found God after struggling with depression and anxiety and she immediately accused me of being homophobic because I said I was Christian (born again I guess, we both grew up Catholic). Which was severely not the case. She also accused me of being so different that it's like she doesn't even know who I am anymore. I let her vent about the drifting and the differences we both grew into since middle/ high school, without even mentioning to her that she was different too, it's called growing and changing as you age, but I still loved her just the same...then I expressed how I don't want to lose her over this and we eventually squashed the beef. I know she doesn't like my boyfriend of 5 years all that much, mainly because she thinks he changed me, not taking into account that I can make my own decisions and have my own thoughts that that nothing to do with my boyfriend's. 2 years go by and during those two years, her father passes away unexpectedly. He was the light in her life and it was so painful to see everything she went through during that time. I was there for her as often as she needed me and then some. Eventually, things started to feel really one-sided. I kept ignoring it because I knew she was grieving, but after almost 2 years, it was starting to get to me. My calls and texts were hardly received, she always seemed to be in a rush to talk to me, it felt like walking on eggshells. I guess now, what really bothers me is that a friend of hers is going through a hard time with her SO and my best friend has been extremely supportive and just going above and beyond with this other girl, while all I feel like I've received from her is criticism of my relationship, my values, my political views (which she really knows almost nothing about but assumes my position). As I write this, I'm actually getting angry at how much I've been there for her, but how little she has been there for me. I'm extremely scared to bring all this up to her because she is so critical and everything she says cuts deep. It's not a good feeling, but neither is this. I don't really know what to do, and I can't imagine losing her. I would hope I can work up the confidence to tell her how I'm feeling and we can have a rational conversation about it.

"Post: I die a little inside with every customer (TW) Let me start by saying I've been getting help for chronic depression and anxiety since January. I take sertraline (50mg) every day, and it's helped me tremendously. I was hired as a cashier at a fast food job in November of last year, and it was a huge step forward. No education, no GED, no transportation, no job experience (except for working for a family company since I was a literal child); needless to say, I felt like I overcame a hump that had been looming in front of me for quite some time. I've had extreme social anxiety since my early teens, so diving headfirst into a cashier job seemed a bit counter-intuitive. Now, I don't know if it was the medication or simply having no choice but to face my fears every day, but the anxiety has completely faded. Gone. Zilch. Good, right? Well, in its place, a little seedling sprouted, and as time goes by it swells inside my heart and head, pushes against my skull, crushes my organs, my spark, my will to move forward. I hate people so fucking much. I am so damn tired of hearing you complain that the price of a sandwich has increased by fifty fucking cents. I am so damn tired of cleaning up after your little brats after they throw their food on the floor. I am so fucking fed up with you cancelling an entire fucking order, after it was already prepared, because the soda machine was out of cherry Fanta. What the fuck is wrong with you? I go home and utterly dread the next day of picking up the slack of my coworkers and dealing with a shitload of entitled, spoiled assholes. Every now and then, there is an angel. Someone who isn't a total asshole to me...it could be something so small to you, but it can make my entire day that much easier. Perhaps you already know what you want to order, and don't hold up a line of ten people because you're picky as fuck. Perhaps you tip me 96 cents. Usually, it's treating me like I'm a feeling, thinking human instead of the shit on your heel. I bend over backwards for these people and do my best to let them know that they're truly appreciated. I've come so far, and yet I'm so close to giving up. It's wearisome forcing a smile every day and powering through as if I have a promising future, when I don't. I pretend that I don't slice my thighs with razors, that I'm not covered in self harm scars, that all is well. I pretend I don't fantasize every day about diving headfirst in front of a semi truck.

In short, it seems like because of her past relationships, she kind of has an unhealthy mentality around 'earning' affection, and definitely has some sort of commitment issues (apparently her last ex said that he didn't really love her for the last year of their relationship, but was too afraid of hurting her to break up with her). All of this makes me ambivalent about broaching the topic of a committed relationship with her because I don't know how she'll react, but at this point we've both admitted we're falling for each other.",dreaddit-train.csv

Post: As a result I had a total burn out. Many months ago the situation with my abuser came up between this friend and I. I explained some stuff but she said it was too overwhelming for her to hear so I never brought it up again. My response to her saying I do nothing was just explaining that I don’t tell people why I’m in this situation because it scares people. It’s often retraumatizing when I tell people and their reaction is either to get scared and shut me down or not believe me at all. Her response was that a lot of people have f’d up things they have to deal with but they still have to do stuff.,dreaddit-train.csv

We are also still very behind in our utility bills.

I said okay sure. I live in 500 sqft a studio but I have a pullout couch in addition to my bed.

He just magically knew what and how to talk to everyone, like the people that I wanted to talk to, but could never, he had already been there and done that.

My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day. My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents. I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it.

I've tried to challenge her on it as a means of settling my anxiety but this was met with a touch of hostility, in that 'yes everything is fine, i don't need to be in constant communication with you,' but I'm just so concerned that she's pulling away or losing interest and its all falling out of my hands.",dreaddit-train.csv

Just kept telling me to do the same things over and over, when I told her these solutions either didn't work, or in some cases (going out for a walk for the sake of it, rather than with an intended destination/goal, for instance) made things worse. Because if my mind's left to wander, without something to focus on, something to distract myself, it starts tearing itself apart, ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past, ways I've failed or fallen short, and I end up worse off than when I started. So, I eventually stopped going. And then, eventually stopped taking my meds, mostly because of not having the money to afford them when my father walked out, and the house practically started falling down around our ears over a course of a couple years; the heating just before winter because we couldn't afford oil, then losing water due to burst pipes, then the gas and finally electricity due to nonpayment.",dreaddit-train.csv

I try going outside late at night and early in the morning so I can run, but there are like always people around and it drives me insane. I don't know how to maintain the motivation to be active while dealing with my anxiety that keeps convincing me that everyone is judging me and may yell insults at me or the other side of things: may kidnap, attack or murder me (since I go out when it's pitch black outside to reduce the ability to see me).",dreaddit-train.csv

So, the counselor and I took her to the Emergency room to see if they could admit her at the local hospital. There, she absolutely *refused* to have her blood drawn and the ER told me that they were just going to have to discharge her if they couldn't get the tests.",dreaddit-train.csv
"Post: Due to daughters older sibling and mother being the type that craves and feeds on enormous emotional attention, I am realizing how she's ended up making herself smaller and downplaying her own problems to not ""add to the burden"". AFAIK there has been no physical abuse, but there has been geographical and emotional abandonment from mother and brother, and probably a feeling of emotional abandonment from myself. She's smart and ambitious, but unfortunately totally lacking in self-confidence and has a habit of choosing away people and situations. I realize that through a life of undiagnosed ADD I've adopted a myriad of ""bad habits"" I will need to address for both mine and our sakes, as well as a ton of structure etc that need to be put in place. In that frame it would be very helpful to start at an end that benefits both of us, or at the very least doesn't exacerbate her PTSD.",dreaddit-train.csv

The others however I remember vividly to a point, one was a very inappropriate tickling game where my sister was under her duvet and he was on top of her tickling, except he was also humping, I can't remember much more than that, the other is walking to his house, I remember the exact route, going in and him showing me his house, I can't remember anything once he showed me his bedroom, other than the bedding was white, I don't remember leaving or what happened in between, but I remember things like he had an Eiffel Tower figure he made in his front room. I started masturbating at a young age and I wonder if this is linked in. I've been suffering a lot recently, and I am on medication and undergoing therapy, but these bouts are cyclic, I always end up back in this position after a while, perhaps not as severe as the one I'm in now, but I feel that it's in part due to having such little recollection of my childhood (can't remember much of it or my teen years), I want to be able to have a definitive answer to whether I was sexually abused so I can put it to rest, the not knowing is really hurting and the flashbacks I have are intrusive and upsetting, I don't know how to confront this situation and get over it.",dreaddit-train.csv

I realize a fear of death is a bit unbeatable, but some how that seems to give me a bit of peace. The one that I have a hell of a time with is fear of what other people thinking.",dreaddit-train.csv
"Post: I've had anxiety for a few years (I'm seventeen) and only got diagnosed properly like 7 months ago alongside depression. Over the past few months I've developed a stutter and I've been unable to form proper sentences which has given me a fear of talking to friends and even just talking in general. I'm not the smartest person in my family and have got the lowest grades but I've always been excellent with my literacy but when I'm talking to either my family or friends, the words just can't come out. I've recently had something happen to nw where I was used for comedy & told to ""try electro shock therapy"" to help my mental illnesses by some guy pretending to be there for me. This is only really related because this has made me really antisocial and I can't trust people anymore.",dreaddit-train.csv

DPDR arose from this maelstrom of angst, something who's existence I was completely unaware of, particularly as to being related to anxiety.

About 7-8 months ago I left my abusive ex-girlfriend, she was my first serious partner and we were together for about a year and a half. She pretty much ruined my life, and I experienced all kinds of abuse while I was with her (and even when we were apart), including emotional, mental and physical. Fast forward to today, I have a new relationship with the sweetest girl in the world, a brand new start since I’m a freshman in college, and there’s a good chance that I will never have to speak with or maybe even see my ex for a good while.",dreaddit-train.csv

Police came, spoke with me, decided I needed to go to the hospital against my will.

I cant spend the rest of my life working and spending time at home away from other people.

She doesn't have many hobbies and works in a pub so I can't talk about her interests really as the only think she kinda likes is textiles and she doesn't do it anymore as she's so focused on her job.

I called the vet and they suspect it could be heartworms, so while I have the $50 for the office visit, I don’t have the $45 for the test. Any help towards this would be greatly appreciated.

After vitals were normal, the doctor said that when I drive for awhile, my body's posture is activating my sympathetic nervous system.

Now I know you guys may ask why did you continue to allow the abuse with you if you had stopped it with your mother before?

I had just gotten out of the military (note this story has nothing to do with trauma from the military) and I moved back to my home town so I could finally see my friends and family regularly again. All seemed like it was going well. I got a job at the local hospital, I'm currently living with my sister so that's helping with money. I just feel like I'm a shell of the person I was before I met my Ex. I don't know how to be happy anymore and I don't even remember what it feels like to experience true elation for something. I use to love writing or reading, I can barely do both anymore. This is the most I've written, and meant it, in a long time. I took some of those online tests, just a minute ago, to tell me if it was possible that I was depressed. Everyone of them said, ""You are likely Severely Depressed"". This feels like I'm just ranting but I needed to tell someone this and this seemed like the only spot to put this down.",train.csv
"Post: I‚Äôm 16 I‚Äôve been severely suicidal since I was 10. When I was around 11 I slit my wrists and my parents walked in when I was bleeding out. They said they were ‚Äòbusy‚Äô working and gave me antiseptic cream and bandaids instead of taking me to the hospital my dad walked in later that night and cried over me and basically called me selfish. No one ever talked about it again and I never received help. I‚Äôm now in 11th grade and school has never been worse I‚Äôve already had 2 pretty serious breakdowns and I‚Äôm only 6 weeks in. Through extensive online research I found some ‚Äòpainless‚Äô suicide methods and purchased the drugs and blades necessary to pull it off. I almost did it the other night but I want to finalise some things first. My mum is gone so just now I went to my dad for a final plea for help and when I told him he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs all in your head‚Äù ‚Äú the only thing you have is self pity‚Äù etc. I just know I‚Äôm going to end it all pretty soon, I‚Äôm not sure when but almost definitely soon.

I'm 16 and a sophomore in high school. We met last year as freshmen and I had never had any friends before so I immediately just accepted her. She was 13 when we met so she started kindergarten early and skipped a grade. then there's me who's two years older but nothing compared to her. She gets straight A's, takes all AP and honors classes, made VARSITY softball as a freshman (age of a 7th grader), got the lead roles in all the theatre shows, and just has a perfect life. Then there's me who doesn't have the best home life. I've tried telling her I can't sleep over because I need my meds and for other reasons. But then she just tells me ""oh everyone feels sad sometimes. You don't need those stupid pills."" Or if I tell her that it's my anxiety and ADHD pills she is like ""everyone has some form of ADHD. Have you seen everyone who can't pay attention? Those pills don't do anything"" I'm very reluctant to end our friendship because I don't have any other friends. Also my Mom has gotten really close with their family and I can't end the friendship beacuse that would be awkward. I feel like this is toxic though.

I got rejected a couple hours ago to someone who i now realize doesnt care about me. She claims to but I know she doesnt. She acts just like how Ive been acting for the past 4 years pretending to be happy whenever someone else is present. I don't think my parents would care if I did rid myself, every night I hear them talking about how stupid and worthless I am but during the day they pretend like they care alot. I know they dont. Funny thing is whenever I think about ending myself I dont get sad. I feel some kind of joy, some kind of hope. I have attempted to take my life 5 times so far (I will spare you details) however I have a different feeling about attempt #6. I think it might actually work, which makes me happier than almost everything else. I am lucky to go 5 minutes without thinking of suicide.

"Post: From what I've seen, people suffering from depression feel down even though things around them are somewhat okay. As for me, I just got divorced, my ex-wife is an incredibly manipulative narcissist, and we have a young child together. She's accused me of horrible things that I would never do in a failed attempt at full custody. I'm constantly battling her over our child. In the past she has successfully isolated and controlled me through guilt and accusations. She almost succeeded in manipulating the courts. The legal fees appear to be leaving me bankrupt. My thoughts are full of her, her constant false accusations and how to defend against them. I'm on a tenure track at a university, but that job is f-ed now because I can't concentrate on my research for longer than 5 minutes. So yeah, I'm kind of feeling down. My ex is abusive and is so good at it that the legal system and even women's abuse counselors will back her and protect her. I'm in therapy. Started going to church. Prayer helps me get back to sleep now. Trying to cut down on drinking. Exercising a lot. Still can't focus on work, so I'm now focusing on how to change careers and stay in the same area (close to our child.) What should I do? Am I suffering from depression? When this abuse and false accusations first started a few years ago, I thought about wanting to die. My career is f-ed now because of this. That makes me worry about future custody battles.

The few that are posted are overlooked and ignored in favor of discussing symptoms. Someone posts on here that they often feel like killing themselves and they get a myriad of posts from people who just tell them they also feel that way.

I get up, go to class so I can have a career, to pay every bill and buy mundane things which add value to my life. But what is the point? At the end of the day, none of this matters. For anyone. No one has a purpose. Some people may be richer than others and can experience more things, but who cares? We all die anyway. Everyone spends 80-95 years chasing dreams that don‚Äôt matter, we‚Äôre all just existing to exist. This makes it hard for me to care about anything. Nothing matters to me. I‚Äôm in my last year of college and will have an education degree I plan to do nothing with because the thought of teaching 30 individuals to become something in life sends my anxiety through the roof. I truly just want to die and not deal with the unnecessary stress of life but that would then ruin the lives of my loved ones around me. I‚Äôm stuck. I‚Äôve been this way for about 3 year now. I don‚Äôt see a light at the end of the tunnel, and everyday I pray I‚Äôll die in a car accident or something so I won‚Äôt have to kill myself.

So I can feel horrible for a whole month but after feel like I'm on top of the world for a bit. One of the sad realizations of 2017 for me is realizing that there are a lot more people who suffer from depression than I thought. I'm starting to build a good support group of friends and family when things get tough, but I haven't felt there are too many groups (to my knowledge) to talk about depression, except here. Are there any sort of discord groups or anything like that that focus on depression? Maybe even YouTubers that talk about their problems with depression. Sometimes depression hits me at the worst times, so there are times where I can't really talk to people for a bit because everyone could be at work or asleep. I think it would be cool to have a place to go to to talk with like minded people that is maybe a little faster than making a reddit post. I hope I can become active in this community as well.

I can never get anything done, I never feel interested in anything, I always feel tired.. And yet my mom has kind of been pushing me into getting a job while the move situation gets resolved. It really seems like the right thing to do. Yet the idea just feels terrifying. Like I KNOW I should find one, bu I also dread the idea. Probably my anxiety acting up, but also because I worry it'll only make me worse. I'm constantly on-edge and just about anything can ruin my mood for the rest of the day. In my mind, I tell myself that I'm in no condition to work full-time but then I feel guilty because that might just be an excuse.

It's not fair on them. They couldn't know. But I'm still so angry. I'm not supposed to be alive right now and yet, here I am. And it's all because they decided not to go. If I had chosen not to, been moments away and stopped because I'm a coward, that would have been fine. But no. I don't even get to blame myself for it.

I do everything I can to try to keep her happy but it's not good enough. She'd rather be at daycare than at home with me; she cries every day when I pick her up. As soon as we get home, she goes straight to grandma and ignores me for the rest of the day. I get angry sometimes and my first reaction is to yell at her when she's having a bad day and I feel like a total piece of garbage afterward.

"Post: (I'm not a native english speaker, sorry for all the grammatical errors) I feel like I'm a fucking idiot and that the only reason I succeeded at school was because I was working hard, until now. I'm in my first year of college and the second semester started about a month ago but I feel like everything is falling appart. Two teachers barked at me while strongly implying that I was fucking dumb, I studied for several hours for a test and I ended up failing miserably while most of the class (who didn't study at all) found the test super easy. The worse thing is that the place I'm studying at wasn't even the one my high school teachers recommended me to go, thinking it was ""too easy"" for me, but I went to study here anyway because I felt like I wouldn't psychologically handle the option my high school teachers were recommending me to go to (in fact the day before my math finals in hs I was paralyzed on my bed for more than 30min and couldn't stop cyring thinking I wouldn't pass it despite the days I spent studying it). So currently I feel like that I'm just a dumb idiot and that everyone else is simply smarter than me, and the sole reason as to why I succeeded until now was because I cared about my grades but many didn't. I don't know what to do, I don't even know if I even deserve to post something here, I find myself ridiculous and I'm starting to skip meals.",train.csv

"Post: I know a lot have been discussed about SSRI and their potential sexual side effects. For the last 6 months I have been on Fluoxetine and Duloxetine (my shrink thinks that my depression is a result of bad things that happened to me and was planning to wean and stop them within 1 year). However, I had to take a drug screen for work and I read that Fluoxetine can give a false positive result in the UDS and I didn't want to tell my potential employer that and take anti - depressants for the fear of stigmatizing. Anyway, I stopped both SSRIs 1 week before the test (now is 10 days without them) and I don't feel any different, in fact if anything, I feel happier, but the most striking was my marked increase in my libido and the capability to ejaculate once again :) When I was on the SSRIs I had turned into an asexual creature and if I ""force"" my self to have sex or watch porn I had a half - @ass erection and (kind of whiskey d!ck) and more often than not I had to fake and orgasm (using a condom) or if by any chance I can finish is after a long ""banging"" and with an almost painful spasms of my legs, really weird sense. Now I feel like I am a 30 yr old (I am mid - 40s) - have a ""morning wood"", I regained my interest in sex, I am able to ejaculate, etc. I am nervous to start the meds again, but don't want to go back to the deep depression that I was before in case they had any effect.

I thought I was doing fine and adapting. But I guess not. I woke up feeling ""off"" and had acute anxious feelings about my well being and mental health. I've never really felt better. I feel empty. Lonely. I've been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist at school, and we upped my Zoloft to 150 mg with not much change in my mood. So now I'm on 100 mg of pristiq and have yet to witness any change.

I'm so scared and sad. I'm trying to get better. It's like I'm trapped in my own mind. I dont want to drop college because I know it will hurt my future.

We spend most of our time doing things we don't want to do: working, cleaning, driving in traffic, feeling hungry, experiencing physical discomfort, etc, etc. Why would it not be better to not exist at all (I don't believe in an afterlife) rather than experience the totality of consciousness? Now other people will mourn my death, this much is true. But they're going to mourn my death regardless of when it happens. No mourning is avoided by making it happen now.

I don't know what to do... I know where I can get sleeping pills, so I'm just afraid my daughter will loose her mother soon. And I'm in Norway, I'm afraid of telling doctors about my suicide thoughts because here they are really happy to take away child from your family for every little shit. I don't know what to do. I'm done with this whole life and shit. I have pain in my whole body and I don't have any pain relief meds (because Norway only gives you paracetamol fuckery).",train.csv
"Post: I've been depressed most of my life. I know I should have seeked help long ago because, even now, I have never told my doctors that I'm depressed. When I was a young boy, gaming was my passion. I miss those days; no responsibilities and no meddlesome relationships to distract me from my pasttime. Now I'm much older and the depression hasn't waned a bit. Depression and responsibilities both grew. I got engaged a while back and, as happy as my partner makes me, I still have my personal fits of depression. This may seem cynical, but one person can only do so much for another. I wish I didn't, but I have accepted that painful truth. What really hurts me the most about my state now is that I can no longer truly enjoy playing video games anymore. As I said before, gaming was my passion. Now that I don't have any motivation to play as many games anymore, it makes me feel like I'm throwing my wonderful past with gaming away. I'm really sad. I just keep pouring my thoughts out and going on tangents. Sorry for this long rant. Thank you for reading this far.",train.csv

I realize I have to stop doing this, and I tell myself every single time that I won‚Äôt do it again, but I always do. Even though I am currently on an antidepressant it doesn‚Äôt make the suicidal thoughts go away. I can be having an okay day and I will still picture myself with a gun in my mouth or similar things.

I want to know if there's any other ways of solving this because I'm aware of how final suicide is but I know if I try talking to someone about this in real life I will just say things to be considered fine so I don't have to cost my parents money for therapy.

I know she's drunk and over emotional right now, but I feel like an idiot for taking on the responsibility of helping her when I'm not even in the right mindset myself.

"Post: Like most everyone in this subreddit I suffer from depression I've been dealing with since I was a child now well into my 30's. In spite of it have able been able to get things done like graduating from college even after loosing someone I loved. It was one of the hardest things that I've ever done. However, these past few years have been really pushing my limits. I won't go into details but things are bad and I need to be learning new skills on the side as my job may not be as secure (thought I don't even like it). That way at least if I do lose my job I can be working in a different field. I can't seem to be able to muster enough focus/energy to even get started. There were only 2-3 things that helped me to deal with my depression (non drug related) but now I can't seem to get any enjoyment out of them anymore. I have always felt that since I've dealt with depression for such a long time I would always find a way to function. This no longer the case and I'm at a crucial time where that weight I feel on my back can't be interfering with what I have to do. So to those of you out there on the same crappy boat how do you maintain enough function to get thru the things you have to do?

"Post: I have just moved in with my gf in December, graduated a year ago and have begun working in a company. The company's a successful growth company. I have liked to work there, but there are some problems. I had a conversation with my bosses about my performance, and they said that they're not sure if I will get to continue there after the test period. I don't mind criticism, I know I can do better, but f.ex. right now I've been in a flu for about 3 weeks, and my boss has suggested that I shouldn't have a day off even though I would feel like it. Everything about this situation makes me feel pressurised, and I wake up every morning feeling reluctant to go to work. It's not nice to feel like every day matters at work, when normal routines are starting to feel like effort. When I get home from work, I usually just slob on the couch and watch comedies or other funny videos to feel better. I sleep quite ok, could do with a few more hours. I'm grateful to have gotten an opportunity to work in such a successful company. After all, in these times, even getting work is not certain. I have been depressed before. At that time, I was just 18 and trying to figure out what the hell was I doing. Ended up quitting my job then. Tl;dr: I work at a successful place, just moved in with gf. Felling pressure to do more at work, and at the same time feeling I should have time with myself. Would appreciate tips on how to get over this feeling.",train.csv

I moved last summer for university, to try and get away from what/who I once was. I have met some amazing people here, but nobody seems to have any time to care for me. Heres a quick rundown of my 2020 so far: I got a shoulder injury, had time out of the gym, was unable to compete because I was too weak. My girlfriend of 2.5 years and I split up. I developed a drug addiction to cope with the pain. I've hated my body more than ever and have lost all appetite and stopped eating. Sex drive has plummeted. Started hooking up with a girl but couldnt maintain an erection- realised I was using her for hugs and kisses to numb the feeling of loneliness. I want to go to a doctor but my brain keeps telling me I'm feeling sorry for myself and this is all for attention. I even feel like this writing this post.

About a month ago, I was moderately depressed but a video triggered what I thought was euphoria in me. I have experienced moderate anxiety episodes before. At first, it didn't feel like it, I felt realllly good, but then I thought, ""I haven't felt like this, my heart is racing, this must be anxiety"" and then it changed to another anxiety episode.

Any advice from those who have/had depression would be greatly appreciated. Well, just ranting for online does relief everything in which I had bottled up. So on new year, I just broke up with my girlfriend(4months) and connections from my close friends. My relationship was toxic as it felt as though I was the only one trying as I clinged onto the thoughts that she would be the one who help me to get out of depression. She was initially really supportive and that was why I was attracted to her, she helped me to elavate my abuse of tobacco but I feel as though I'll fall back into that sinkhole. People change and I don't blame her. She feels exhausted and does not feel the same way anymore. Right now I'm just really exhausted of everything. I have scheduled appointments for a psychiatrist that was done by the SAF, Singapore's Army basically. I don't know what to expect besides perhaps being announced as clinically depressed.

"Post: I've been dealing with mild depression since October (self-diagnosed, nothing formal). I've mostly been able to deal with it. The last few months though, it's slowly getting worse. The lack of energy, loss of interest in enjoyed activities. All I do is work is come home. On the weekends, I just turn hermit and avoid things. Even doing self care doesn't help. Today, I haven't been out of bed except to go to the bathroom and eat a bagel. My roommate came in to talk and see if I was okay. He had helped me in the past deal with this, but even he's not sure what to do. In about 3 months, I'm supposed to move in with the love of my life. I'm moving to another state to do it. I know I need to start therapy, but I know changing therapists at the beginning of recovery can be dangerous. I'm so lost that I just don't know where to start.",train.csv
"Post: So I have been in depression for almost more than 2 years now. At the start of the those 2 years, I quit my job and literally spent 2 years sitting at home. Now I want to get back to life. However there is a constant thinking in my head that I am a loser. and that I have not achieved anything in life. which makes me wonder what should I do now. All I see is the darkness. I have started to believe that I need to get out of depression first before thinking anything about the career. Is that approach okay ???. If yes then can someone please guide me how to move forward ? I have already expressed myself on this subreddit the past week and the replies i got were encouraging. However I now think that there is a phase or gap between the mind filled with depressive thoughts and the optimistic mind looking for something for the career. I am 27 and will be 28 in 7 months and I want to transition from the former to the latter as soon as possible. can someone help me with that ? just for the reference (if anyone wants to read, this is my previous post) https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5k6k7g/i_have_wasted_my_life_and_i_have_no_idea_what_to/",train.csv

That is, I have to take doses higher than average / recommendation to achieve the same level of therapeutic effects. Personally I like the effects of the medicine combination of sertraline (Zoloft) and bupropion XL (Wellbutrin XL), but I have progressively felt the need to increase the dose. Have / had anyone ever been on sertraline (Zoloft) 300mg or more? Did it work better for you? Did any adverse effect happen? Have / had anyone ever been on bupropion XL (Wellbutrin XL) 450mg or more?

"Post: Feeling this way isn't a bad thing. Something that is said to much in our society is that feeling suicidal if a bad thing. The whole ""don't do it,"" line is just a rewording of our society sentiment towards suicide. You should just know that feeling suicidal, even to the point of writing notes and making plans isn't a bad thing. There is no shame in falling when you've been beaten. Feeling suicidal is a perfectly natural response to bias, depression, psychosis, or any other horrible thing; you can't go near a fire without getting hot. There is nothing wrong with you for feeling suicidal, for feeling like you hate yourself. Maybe the reason you hate yourself is because you've never been loved, so you see no proof that you are worthy of any. Maybe it's because you have been biasdv so thoroughly you've been programmed to hate yourself. No matter the cause, I cannot stress this enough, it is not a bad thing. The bad thing is whatever caused you to feel this way",train.csv

I haven‚Äôt been to therapy since 2014, and it was mostly for dealing with depression symptoms. Therapy helped me tremendously, and I felt better talking with complete transparency about my baggage with someone equipped to handle it. I went back recently and the interaction boiled down to them telling me 1) I was medicated at too young of an age (started SSRIs very young) and therefore my parents raised me incorrectly, and 2) Skepticism that the therapy ever helped me. He literally asked me, ‚Äúdid that even help if you stopped going?‚Äù He told me his background was in social service, and he recorded the session for the school‚Äôs records.

About one or two days out of every month it hits me with reminders that it's still there. Today is one of those days. I woke up next to my girlfriend (who I absolutely love) and I just feel like I'm always worrying about doing/saying the right thing. When something bothers me, I tell her. No matter how small it may seem. It just helps me get things off my chest and out of my mind. She hates when I do this, because she thinks I'm trying to pick a fight, and argue over something so meaningless. She tells me if roles were reversed, these things wouldn't bother her. So how do I even deal with these thoughts? I can't just hold them back, because then it's obvious something is on my mind. I can't just push it out of my mind by rationalizing it, because I'm constantly worrying. I also feel like there are so many guys that would love to have her.

"Post: My high school career wasnt the best but it certainly was full of great memories and long term friendships *(some of which I am still in contact with over a decade later)*. Whenever I go through old pictures or Facebook posts/messages from my high school days, I instantly feel sad and depressed because of how much fun those days were and that I can never re-live those amazing days ever again. What makes this feeling worse is that I've lost contact with many of my close high school friends so even if I wanted to get in contact with them again, it couldnt happen. Some I know have moved to different cities/countries and some now have families and established careers and im just sitting here going through old memories wishing that I could re-live those days. We're all happy when high school is finally over but many years later, that feeling isnt the same anymore. I know its not just me who feels this way but this feeling F'ing sucks and at the same time I dont want to get rid of those memories that keep bringing those feelings back because they mean a lot to me. It just sucks that I cant do anything to bring those days back.",train.csv

"Post: It will get better for you, the person with more than a handful of friends worried for you and asking if you'll be okay, the person who actually has a significant other who you can always turn to, the person who has a community that accepts them and doesn't discriminate against them for their entire identity. The person who only has depression and not a literal learning disability that impacts how you interact with others, and they treat you horribly because of it.

No, shithead, maybe you're treating me like crap and I have a legitimate reason to be unhappy about that.

I used to be an advanced student in elementary school and had a passion for reading and learning; I could absorb knowledge and I had a social life. Then, things took a drastic change in 5th grade for no obvious reason. I suddenly felt tired all the time; as if I didn't sleep enough. All I could think was ""why am I so tired? I'll sleep more tonight"" every day. For the first time in my life, I failed a test. I broke down in tears in the middle of class and was surrounded in anxiety and depression. I also somehow ""obtained"" adhd/extreme forgetfulness and started losing my ability to properly comprehend people speaking to me and use my mind's eye to visualize anything... I was uninhibited in many social situations (my best friend's mom thought I was using drugs before I even knew what a marijuana was) and extremely anxious in others. Stimulants didn't help much besides giving me energy and although anti-depressants help with my mood, all the other symptoms remain. I have a feeling that this is a brain tumor or brain damage because of how it affects me so broadly. I've never had suicidal thoughts and honestly, I don't think too much at all. Nothing crisp, anyways. I'm 19 now and not sure where to proceed from here. My mom believes it's because I became an atheist and my dad thinks it's because I just don't care.

"Post: So, I've been trying to work on a research paper since October, and everything I came up with, my professor turned down. Around the end of November, right before Thanksgiving, my professor gave me a topic and a list of books. I took it because what other choice did I have? My professor knows I work two jobs, commute an hour to school everyday and an hour home, and suffer from bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety. On top of this, I was taking four other classes that were just as demanding. Here I am now, sitting at my desk, looking at this pile of books, and I'm starting to physically hit myself with them from stress and anxiety. I have no idea what to do. Part of me wants to take this ""F"" on the class and drop out, but another part of me knows how horrible that would be and how much disappointment I'll be filled with, not to mention my family. I just am completely miserable and lost.",train.csv
"Post: Hello everyone, I've been struggeling with this issue for a long time now. As long as I can remember, my mom had an odd way of expressing her love and nurturing my growth. I remember when I was 13 she would make me scrub the floors on my bare knees because I didn't help around enough in the house. While doing that she would sing along to a song, calling me a coward and a weakling. She also saw me develop my eating disorder but never said anything untill it was too late. I've lost a lot of weight since then and come a long way but she never fails to rub it in my face. Even if I eat an apple as a snack, she would tell me to ""Watch the line"". These are just mere fragments of how she is towards me. Recently, I was talking to her about life partners. She flat out told me that, if anyone were to love me, they'd have to choose it very profoundly because I make everyone have a hard time. Now, don't get me wrong, I did have a rebellious teen period. I just don't know why she can't get a new image of me? Does anyone have tips on how to survive this passive agressive fiesta my mother has? Maybe things I can do to show her how I've changed? Would it be an idea for me to get some counseling? Pls help me...",train.csv

"Post: Besides my therapist, the only person I really open up to in a serious way is my best friend. Only one out of my tons of friends. For everyone else, I only talk about depression in a comedic manner, making jokes about it and laughing. I do that because I feel I‚Äôm supposed to be the fun one in the group, and while I think I am (I always make them and myself laugh), if I get super serious they‚Äôll either make fun of me, stop being my friend, or get super worried and tell someone. I don‚Äôt want any of those to happen. Anyway, back to my best friend. Since she‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm serious with, I constantly talk to her about things that bother me, my true feelings, and how suicidal I am. I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm being a nuisance, constantly talking to her about these dark things. She doesn‚Äôt need to hear all of that. She pities me, as do all of my other friends. I really don‚Äôt want to annoy her with how much I‚Äôve been telling her. Recently, she even said that she feels very depressed, and she‚Äôs been talking to me about it. She never mentioned me doing anything to make her feel like that, but I feel like I was a part in it. My texts probably affected her a lot. It hurts to think that, but I feel that‚Äôs the truth.

I don't know what to say, and I would feel guilty saying this to the people around me because I will bother them. I told it to my best friend but she is suicidal and severely depressed and she started to self harm again after I told her I self harmed and I don't want to make her feel worse. I want to support her although I don't have the strength to do that. I told it to a friend and to my sister as well and although they are helping and kind, I don't want to tell them how bad I feel. I don't know how to. I tried to see psychologist but I have to wait untill at least april. This is a free psychologist and I can't afford to see another one earlier if it means I have to pay.

"Post: I've already had a lot going on in my personal life, and I was closer to suicide than I'd ever been. Then there was a huge argument among my friends. I won't get into details, but I don't think they'll make up. I was right in the middle and now I need to fucking pick a side. But I don't want to pick a side. If I do I'll lose some of my friends, and I am neutral on the whole situation anyway. If I don't pick a side, I'll start spending more time with one group than the other because I hate changing things, and then they'll hate me. So I'm going to isolate. I won't sit with them in the morning or at lunch, I'll only work with them in class if they come to me, etc. If they want to talk to me they'll find me. I don't have any other friends, so I'll be completely alone. Of course, that'll only happen if I don't end up killing myself before the end of March break. I was so close to suicide before the argument, but now I'm pushed past my limit. I'll probably go for the next opportunity I get (i.e. know I'll be home alone for 2+ hours). I just can't take this anymore, it's all become too much. I don't really want to die, but nothing ever gets better so what's the point. I just give up.",train.csv

"Post: I remember the first time I ever had suicidal thoughts, it was 4 years ago and I was living away from home for university. I remember coming home that weekend and breaking down in front of my parents straight away. That experience was horrifying especially because the thoughts were really severe and that was the start of me being depressed. Now, 4 years later I have periods of severe depression where these thoughts come up again. However, now whenever I get these thoughts I am able to keep them to myself for an extended period of time and just carry on as normal. A major difference between then and now is that I actually want to die now whereas before that thought was completely alien to me. My desire to die is pretty strong right now mainly because I am scared about the new year and the last few months have gone really shit. I love my family so much but I feel like my anxiety and depression is going to win very soon. I was thinking of going to my old therapist and showing her my diary with all of my suicidal thoughts with the intention of getting hospitalised but that comes across like attention seeking and that I don't really have a desire to die. Part of me doesn't want to go and show it to her but then another part really does. She is the only one I would show this to. I am a coward though and don't really have the fearlessness needed to actually commit suicide which is another negative for me. Sorry for the long post! What do you guys think?",train.csv

I loved this girl, I put in so much effort to be a person suited to society and not an overly cynical, disfunctional boyfriend in order for her to like me and so I could find happiness. I'm sitting here now writing this because I have no one, I feel physically sick with the way she is treating me and how once again she has abandoned me. She is fucking with me, ontop of all the bad shit that has recently happened to me. I can't function now, I feel so helpless, I don't know what to say or do, I constantly feel overwhelmed with anxiety. I haven't been this depressed in years. This is such a dark place and I have no one. I just want to end it. Please anyone give me some advice.",train.csv
"Post: So, I have been thinking of harming myself lately even though it's been a while since I've done it. I've been able to keep myself from harming myself or doing drugs for a while now but something just snapped in recent months that's making me just irritable, impatient, and wanting to spiral out of control again. I just feel like a shell and any kind of physical pain is like breath of fresh air. Anyone else go through something like this? If you got through it, how?",train.csv
"Post: I‚Äôm the last guy people would expect. I was really well liked and social in high school, good family, pretty decent money. But right now my depression is so bad I can barely muster the effort to even write this post. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I really want to die. I should be a freshmen in college, I had gone to UMD for a month and the depression got so bad that after a month I had to drop. I couldn‚Äôt go to classes, I felt alone, the girl I really loved was ignoring me, and I felt like I was living an entirely new life. I come home and it‚Äôs just gotten worse, everything is hard. Everyone is doing more things than me. My friends never invite me with them, I‚Äôve started smoking weed daily and I‚Äôve put on more weight (I used to be too skinny). I can barely shower or put on socks in the morning, how can I work? I didn‚Äôt even go in on New Year‚Äôs Day out of emotional pain and now I have to work tomorrow morning and I‚Äôm sitting here terrified of what will happen. I want to end up dead without the pain, or the heartbreak it leaves behind but I‚Äôm just too scared of making a mistake or what comes after. Everyday hurts. I can‚Äôt go on much longer, money is so tight and everyday just something new goes onto my plate. I‚Äôve tried a million medications with no luck, I‚Äôve attempted multiple therapists and ADT programs, nothing. I can‚Äôt work but I have to. I haven‚Äôt waken up before 4 pm in a week. It hurts.

Genius, dad. I just need to stop FEELING and study my ass off. It makes so much sense. Why didn't I think of that? &amp;#x200B; And when I'm on the balcony crying and so close to jumping and you change the subject to this semester's grades again, I guess that's good too! Of course, grades are all that matter. &amp;#x200B; And mom, I guess hating your child for being broken by your bias is logical too! I mean, how dare I make you feel bad by crying and trying to hang myself after you shook me and screamed in my face and told me I was no longer in the family? That's just what a child deserves for saying she doesn't love you! You're so damn right! &amp;#x200B; Where the hell did you think this was gonna go? Did you actually think your idiocy would keep me alive? Did you think you could fuck me up and then take all the credit when I claw my way to the top despite your best efforts to kill me? &amp;#x200B; I often wish I could die just to show you what you've done to me.",train.csv
"Post: I have been isolated for most of my life. Every possible action I could take to improve my life has been rendered meaningless by previous attempts at averting the disaster that will be my future. I feel like I am doomed forever and that nobody will love me. It's too late. I am way too far behind to catch up with the normal crowd. I have zero friends and literally no family to turn to in times of desperate need. I have tried talking to doctors and therapists and that never worked either. Whenever I bring up my problems, they say I am ""indulging in self pity"" or they treat me like I am blaming other people for my misery. What am I supposed to do when my whole life has sucked and on top of that, my depression is getting worse? It hurts whenever people try to take the situation and blame it on me, when they don't know me. Fuck them. I don't know the point of this post. But, one thing I am certain about is that I am ready to die. I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know how to turn around my life. I don't know how to find love and I doubt anyone will love me (and if you are going to tell me it's too early to kill myself, then let me tell you that for most people, it comes naturally without any hard work whatsoever. I, however, am miserable because I am a fuck up. An aberration. An anomaly). Thank you for reading this garbage and good night.",train.csv
"Post: My wife completely dismisses my depression and also tries to tell me its just an excuse. If I am having an off/bad day she says I am just being an asshole and am trying to ruin her day and sometimes she even goes as far to say that I am ruining her life. I have times when I am down that I cannot be as attentive or give her 100% of my attention, but if I try to say I am just having an off day she says I am just trying to find an excuse for my behavior and not taking ownership of it. There have been days where she says she wants me to get out or leave and I have wanted to, so that I can get away from the pain, but I never do and I end up staying and hoping to just work things out or that maybe I deserve how she treats me. The only thing I feel is really keeping me there with her are out kids, who are the light of my life.

This is the only place I can talk about my feelings, because nobody else would understand. And it's not that anyone here understands, it's that people here are supportive, whether or not they really understand. I always delete everything I post, but the odd comment, it always draws out feelings that would otherwise just churn inside of me. I'm not sure if it makes me feel better, or sadder. But they're both distinct from feeling worse. To everyone here, who is supportive, and who has given me support in the past, I thank you.

My whole life she has talked about how my dad was always so bad because he was bipolar and didn‚Äôt take his medication so I always associated bipolar disorder to raging, abusive behavior and I‚Äôm not like that at all. I didn‚Äôt want her to either belittle my feelings or freak out. Then one night I got drunk and I can‚Äôt even remember how it got brought up, but I remember ugly crying to my mom about how over the past almost 5 years something has changed with me mentally and I‚Äôve been having suicidal thoughts that have increased with time. I‚Äôve always been depressed feeling and I self harmed when I was a teenager, but it was never like this. I think child birth triggered something because this all started with the intense sadness after having my first son (I‚Äôm assuming it was Postpartum Depression, but I never reached out. I was ashamed.) but the suicidal thoughts have increased over the past year and a half and I feel the shift in the manic and depression phases. Even my friends think I‚Äôm ignoring them because I go from chatty and outgoing to MIA for weeks.

"Post: It is midnight and I cannot sleep again. I cannot remember the last time I slept through the night. I sleep in tiny spurts throughout the day but can never stay down for long. I often have nightmares even when I do stay sleeping for some time. The other night, for example, I woke up screaming. I had been dreaming that I was eating a bowl of cereal and looked down and my spoon was covered in spiders. I actually like spiders so I am not sure why it scared me so bad. My husband reached over and held my hand and shushed me until I calmed down. It seems like he is too good to me always. I feel like I don't deserve it. Tonight I looked outside the window at the world as I often do throughout the day. I thought to myself: the people that I have met, all of them, all of the people I have come across... does anyone of them ever think of me? Ever? Do they ever wonder how I am? Even just for a second? If they did, I wish I knew, because I feel like a shadow living life alone inside my house day after day. At the same time I feel that I am unworthy of friendship, community, love. Today at therapy my therapist asked me my goals. I said... to have a friend and to be a part of a small community that truly cared for me. But I have never felt or experienced that. I only know what friendships and loving communities are like from observing others. I truly pity anyone who would want to befriend me, because I think I would make the worst friend.",train.csv

I haven't touched my sketchbook for the whole christmas holiday and I hate myself. I don't know if it was *because* it was christmas or if it just happened but I have felt like utter shit for the past few weeks.

I'm literally shitting myself about having to ask for more special treatment because of my fucking head not working properly. Plus I don't know how he'll react, like what if he says its fine but secretly thinks I'm just milking it to get more time for my work? What if he believes me but decides I'm not mentally capable of staying on the course?

It might just be my family, or it might be me being a raging cunt but talking to people doesn't help me at all I don't want people to instantly relate to what I have to say unless they are being sincere, I want people to help me (does that qualify as using people?) it is relief when someone knows what your talking about. I'm really bad at explaining my feelings in the first place so it's really hard anyways, I just really hate talking to people in general if I could stop talking to people I would be fine just being me and the world. When ever I talk to someone I just feel a deep rage or hatred and I don't know why I just hate everyone What is this? I have one friend, my best friend and I love her to death of course but I just feel like it's so pointless I don't feel sincere when I'm talking with her face to face and like it doesn't feel real or it's not actually happening , or in a way I'm not good enough or interesting enough.

"Post: Hi guys, Never even used reddit before but a close friend of mine suggested asking for help on one of these to keep anonymous. Recently I've finished school and turned 18 (adulthood in Australia). For about 12 months now I've had massively interrupted sleeping schedules, and my body is used to only getting 4-5 hours sleep, sometimes able to function on 2-3. In the last 4 weeks, my thoughts tend to become darker, I feel the sensation of suffocation and drowning (I'm crying as I type this..) I hate the thought of professional help (counsellors/therapists) but I may consider it soon. I have a loving yet dysfunctional family, 2 brothers and loving parents. I live in a good home and have a part time job as a cashier in a supermarket that I've stuck to for 2 years. I'm waiting on university offers and if I'm lucky I'll be moving states to Melbourne City in Victoria for something along the lines of Law/Business. I can't shake these awful feelings, my brain feels continuously sick. Recently I've been experiencing alot of anxiety, something I've never ever felt before, usually I am confident and outgoing. Very recently, my job has made me feel extremely anxious and sometimes I hyperventilate if I'm lacking sleep and feel like I'm sinking even lower... its 3:10am on New Years Day as I write this. I don't know how I feel about disclosing what I think triggered this depression, but I will say I received an unexpected diagnosis after collapsing during work about 3-4 weeks ago. It's been downhill ever since. Please help, happy to answer any more questions, and sorry if I've broken any rules; I'm new to reddit.",train.csv

"Post: Hey ya'll. Hope everyone is having a decent start to the new year. I wanted to see if anybody here had success with cutting back on alcohol consumption, and could potentially talk a little about how it helped them manage their depression. I drink too much. I know it's not good for me (in more ways than one, IBS, depression, anxiety). But I have a really hard time stopping. When I do go for periods without drinking, I think I feel better. So I guess I just wanted to maybe hear from some people who successfully either cut back or cut down altogether, and how this has affected them. Also, if you have any tips, it'd be greatly appreciated. I almost feel like I'm addicted at this point. After getting an app to track my drinking, recommended by my therapist, I notice I'm drinking like 5-7 nights out of the week. And right now I'm drunkenly writing this up. Anyway, I really do hope you hang in there if you're reading this and are in a rough spot, even if this isn't relevant to you.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong but at the same time I'm painfully aware of how awkward, unfunny, negative and all around incomprehensible I am. I can barely string together a coherent sentence. It's like every time I try to talk to someone my mind just blanks and I don't know how to reply, no matter how much time I spend forming my response it's always hard to read trash. I can't do anything right, I'm mean, sarcastic, unfunny, awkward and just plain stupid with an uncanny ability to say the wrong thing at the worst time. I'm just so hopeless, I'm so tired of being me and living with this irredeemable trash pile for a brain.

"Post: Hello. Depression has always been a secondary problem for me, with my main antagonist being severe Harm OCD. But since my relationship ended 8 months ago, I've been stuck in this horrific cycle of absolutely loathing myself, feeling heavy/tired and totally unmotivated to do anything. It's like I'm living in a 2 dimensional world. Nothing in life jumps out and catches my attention like it used to. I used to be quite creative but it's just taken a nose dive. Any work I do is utterly awful and I'm amazed I'm not been kicked off projects (I work freelance). I wake up and I just want to be dead, quite honestly. In fact in the last few weeks I've even found getting out of bed to be a monumental struggle in itself, where I'm almost in tears from the weight of everything. I am getting help with a therapist and am on an SSRI/low dose anti psych. And I've taken their advice seriously in terms of behavioural activation and avoiding staying in bed. I've started cycling again (just done 20 miles today in fact). But I still feel utterly wretched and everything I do is laced with this horrible belief that this is the end and suicide is my only way out of the pain I'm going through. The years ahead fill me with dread (I'm in my 30s). With my Harm OCD I have a huge hatred of myself anyway, but lately things have just got so heavy. I'd just like to know if anybody can relate to my post and has any first person advice?

I got to wondering tonight what that does to a person‚Äôs psyche‚Ä¶ I like to think I introspect a lot and I‚Äôm a thoughtful person because of it, but I think the more likely outcome of all this is that i‚Äôve become socially awkward, paranoid, and bitter towards the people around me. I‚Äôm like a social and societal disease. Every room I walk into it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm sucking all the energy from everyone there. It‚Äôs like that in college too. I just started last semester and I‚Äôve made no friends. i know people in my dorm or in my classes think of me as as that girl with no friends. They either pity me or ignore me like the plague. Sorry for the weird rant. Just wondering if anyone else feels like this‚Ä¶",train.csv
Post: Just had a close friend completely block me and as the title suggests he was a furry. He recently came out as a furry and I was fine with it but recently he started hanging out with his furry friends and just up and blocked me today. One of his new friends might be a pedophile anyways and they were talking about meeting up to go to a con but you know what screw him. So yes I am now depressed as he was my only friend.,train.csv
"Post: So I have rapid cycling bipolar 2 which is a less severe form of bipolar. Anyway, for the past few days I have been manic and it has been worse than it usually is for me. basically, what happened was I started snap chatting girls and complementing them and stuff. I started yelling at people telling them to shut the fuck up because their voices were annoying. that sort of thing. but the thing that I ma the most concerned about is the snapchatting of the girls. I have a girlfriend. I love my girlfriend literally more than anything and it hurts me to know that there is a part of me that would do something like that. I don't know if I'm overreacting or if I'm just a piece of shit that should go die in hell. but this is really killing me and I don't know what to do. she has literally loved me so much and been there for me through everything in my life. and I have done this in return. I guess it technically doesn't count as cheating, but none the less it is still a really shitty thing for me to do. what the fuck should I do with myself now. is it really even my fault? I don't know please help me someone",train.csv

Post: Been fighting with depression for a couple of years now and it has been an uphill battle. Just talked to my doctor yesterday and got diagnosed with bipolar on top of my PTSD from the military. I'm so scared and feel like I have no one to talk to about it. I'm afraid of reaching out to friends out of fear of them leaving me. I only have my brother and I'm scared of how he's going to react since our mother had bipolar as well and ended up committing suicide when I was 15 and he was 18. I just want to be normal and be able to talk about this with someone. Anyone that knows what I'm going through or would like to reach out is appreciated.,train.csv
Post: My boyfriend dumped me yesterday and I was very depressed and down so I asked my ex's friend if he wanted to hang out and talk. We met and had coffee this afternoon and we talked and laughed. At the end he hugged and kissed me on the cheek and asked if I wanted to hang out tomorrow. I said yes. However after I got done with work tonight I was extremely irritated and stressed and just wanted someone to talk to. I asked if he could come over and he took me to a restaurant to get food. I asked him if he could stay with me for a while until I felt better. We went back to my apartment and talked about stuff. I started getting really sad and started to cry. He hugged me and I told me that everything will be okay. I just really wanted love and physical attention at that moment so I kissed him and I climbed on top of him and straddled him and we made out for a while. Why can't I be alone?,train.csv

I've already taken all the classes on that subject, so now I'll be spread too thin to work on side projects for my demo reel. My goal was to spend this break working on projects, improving, and learning. I spent plenty of time working on it, but I haven't been improving much. My sleep schedule started pretty healthy, but now the sun is rising when I finally fall asleep. I love watching movies (that's usually how I pass my time) but now it just seems unappealing.

"Post: I'll try to be as transparent as possible without revealing too much. I am a high school senior, about to graduate in \~3 months. It feels like my life has been defined by the pressure to get good grades; and while I have done decently well in that regard, it has come at the expense at my social life and a lot of other things I value. I used to love the sport I played; now it feels like a burden to even show up to practice. I feel the same way about the other extracurricular activities I'm involved in. I've been rejected to several colleges/programs already, some of which I thought I had a decent shot at getting into. Occasionally, I have what I think are real suicidal impulses, but I know that I'm too much of a fucking pussy to do anything about it. The closer and closer I get to graduation, the lower my work ethic stoops, and the worse I feel about the utterly pathetic excuse of a human being that I now am. The reason why I'm confused is because occasionally, I have moments where I enjoy myself. Where I enjoy life. It feels like I'm bobbling on a line between despair and hope and I'm not sure whether that makes me truly depressed/suicidal.",train.csv

Since summer I am on ADHD medication, Trintellix, and some sleeping aid plus I am trying to limit my caffeine input. The medication helped but not a lot. Some days when I have mandatory classes or lab work at college, early in the morning, I skip sleep completely, being a walking zombie the whole day and then I sleep the next night. When I sleep for 8 hours I just feel tired, if I don't have something obligatory to do I cant get out of bed, I tried a lot of things multiple alarm clocks, have my mom call me nothing, etc. I just want to sleep for 8 hours like a normal person and feel refreshed.

I see people with beautiful appearances not looking happier than anyone else.

But because of the particular struggles I've had throughout my life combined with the crippling depression and anxiety I experience everyday, I can't think of a way to put my capabilities to good use. Like one of the aforementioned posts on this thread, I sometimes have brilliant flashes of motivation and determination and start researching opportunities and ideas of what to do with my life, only for them to falter away and leave myself completely unmotivated/depressed, bereft of hope, and unsure of what my capabilities are.

She had health insurance for when she had her double mastectomy early in 2016 but my father quit paying for it. If she had health insurance, the doctor said she would have been put straight into inpatient care but instead she was urged to go to outpatient. This is just not a possibility with her at this moment. There is no way she is capable of going to get help herself and I do not know what else I can do. I do not have much money as I am currently a college student. I do not know exactly what are my options to try and get her some help and it has been difficult finding the right path to get her some help.

But I am crazily scared of fireworks (childhood trauma here you go) so I decided last minute to stay at our accommodation. A few minutes later 3 friends decided to come back because they were worried and didn‚Äôt want me to spend New Year‚Äôs Eve alone. I resisted in the beginning but they made they‚Äôre decision and stayed with me. We had a small prayer and Christmas cookies and just spend some beautiful hours together. Afterwards they said it was the most beautiful New Year‚Äôs Eve they‚Äôve ever had and same applies to me because I‚Äôm used to spending it alone and having a breakdown. I am just so happy and it‚Äôs unbelievable for me someone actually cared about me. However my ex roommate texted me as well how much she enjoyed being my roommate and how much I taught her. These things are so important for me right now because I realized I‚Äôm really deep in my depression again and struggling with my current situation. I didn‚Äôt think I meant anything to anyone and I was just being there but all of this showed me that there are people that care. And there are also people out there that care about you. You might not think they do or find it completely unbelievable but there are people that care and that would miss you if you‚Äôd just be gone. Take care.,train.csv
"Post: I have both depression and anxiety so it may be more of an anxiety thing, it's hard for me to tell. But long story short when things get really bad for me I sometimes get really clumsy and mess up a lot. For example, today I was skiing. Now I'm a fairly competent skier and I've been skiing most of my life. I was doing fine the last couple days but today I woke up feeling really bad. I eventually pulled myself out of bed and onto the hill, but when I got there it was like I couldn't even ski anymore. I fell a lot and my legs were all wobbly. Yesterday I was doing moguls and was going as fast as I could no problem. Today I fell down on nearly flat terrain. Bent my ski pole.

"Post: I suffered with depression for many years, and haven recently reached a turning point in my life where I finally feel good again, but somethings a little off, all my emotions are less extreme, sadness passes in minutes now and is nowhere near the intensity is was before, but I feel this weird longing to feel an emotion to that same depth and extreme again, has anyone else experienced this?

This is the only life I've got, and someday I'll be dead and forgotten. So why waste it being sad. No longer will I romanticize my depression and let it get the better of me.

"Post: I have seen the same therapist for four years twice a week. We generally meet on the same day, same time, but that's not fixed in stone. There have been occasions where both of us cancel sessions due to sickness, emergency or family issue. That's not a problem. My therapist was scheduling my appointments for this month and the first week of the month was booked when my time to schedule came. She put me on a wait list. I didn't expect a call mostly due to logistics. How did I feel? I was triggered. I felt ignored and taken for granted, but I didn't say anything because that means I have confront one of my demons. My therapist has mentioned several times in the past months that she has a long waiting list of potential clients. Again, I didn't say anything to avoid a possible confrontation. Folks, I'm going to be in therapy a long time, a long, long time. Why? That's what helps me from running off the road. Is it reasonable to ask my therapist that I would appreciate a call to schedule appointments if her schedule is filling up? Should ask her is she trying to tell me something about her waiting list? My therapist is very good at her job. However, I've learned the way not to get too comfortable with any mental health professional.",train.csv

"Post: The method of suicide I selected is hypothermia. There's a river near my house with 40 degree water Fahrenheit, 4 degrees Celsius. Being in there at night, no one would see me. I would tie a rope to a life jacket and confine myself to a tree so I don't drift along the current to a spot where someone would find me. Death would occur within a couple of hours of being in the water, and unconsciousness would happen before then. This method is easy to pull off because it doesn't involve highly intense pain, and I can get out if I really want to. The problem is that this isn't going to work soon, due to the warmer seasons approaching. I have to quickly decide if I want to die.

"Post: https://qz.com/1162154/30-years-after-prozac-arrived-we-still-buy-the-lie-that-chemical-imbalances-cause-depression/ Interesting read, curious what everyone's thoughts are on the article. Recently diagnosed with Dysthymia w/ anxiety, I've been suffering through this for years but only started getting help in the last year. I'm on my 4th antidepressant (zoloft, wellbutrin, lexapro, effexor) now with no success. Additionally i've always been curious if for example SSRI's are the first line in medication assisted treatmeant and the theory is to boost levels of serotonin then why aren't blood samples tested to check what an individuals baseline levels are vs. 2 months later when it reaks peak plasma levels VS. baseline levels of individuals who are not depressed?",train.csv
"Post: So life is okay pretty good I guess wish we made more money but I‚Äôm happy. Or I‚Äôm not. Doesn‚Äôt matter I still feel the very VERY strong need to kill myself and it lasts for a while like a week or for a short term like a few hours. Sometimes I feel like I have to slit my wrists in a tub or put that bullet in my brain or swerve into a truck but I know better. It‚Äôs something in my brain that is triggering this. I am a Christian a real one and I ask God at times to take this from me and it helps but it‚Äôs like a voice a little guy on my shoulder waiting and watching and anything can trigger it. UHG! So frustrating. I think about how my dog, my husband, my brother sister and nieces and nephews need me but the voice doesn‚Äôt care. I was just wondering if there is a part in the brain that does this? I have never done hard core drugs but my mother was high on speed when she was pregnant with me... and she has a dopamine issue because of all the drugs and falls into deep depressions or gets suicidal from it. Maybe it‚Äôs hereditary or maybe because of the drugs she did when pregnant caused the issue with my brain? Anyway any thoughts would be helpful thank you in advance.",train.csv

"Post: All of my life I've struggled to fit in, which coupled with lots of stress and anxiety drove me to depression. I was incredibly lonely, spending my days sleeping and staring into a screen. This year gave me hope though, I met the most amazing girl imaginable - intelligent, funny, sweet/kind, romantic, sexy, same interests, everything I've ever wanted. She was the first girl I've ever dated, someone who actually saw me as something other than the ugly, awkward guy. I actually planned to kill myself around that time, but it all went away after that. I was the happiest guy in the world. That all changed though after she suddenly attempted suicide a few weeks ago. Now all she does is push me away when I try to be there for her (going as far as to dump me) and refuses to see anything beside the negative no matter how much I try to reassure her. She's like an entirely different person now, definitely not the same girl that told me she loved me every night. Meanwhile, I'm even worse than I was before. It's already enough that depression ruined *my* life, but now it's destroying the person dearest to me and there's nothing I can do to stop it. Fuck everything.",train.csv

Last night he said that he thinks I'm not comfortable around him anymore, when the reality is that I'm really uncomfortable with myself and am always self-conscious about it.

"Post: I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression right now and I have been taking prescription meds for the last couple weeks. It really helps! A little background- I got out of a 6 year relationship due to not seeing a future with my ex in December 2019. And then one person who I thought was really close friend of mine, decided he did not want to be friends with me anymore and cut all contacts with me. I get emotionally attached wayyy too easily and this led to me having anxiety, panic attacks and depression - which eventually led to insomnia, IBS, migraines and constant body aches. I started therapy in feb 2020 and have been since going to my therapist every week. And my therapist suggested I look at options for medication and try it. So since the last 2 weeks, I‚Äôm on Lexapro (SSRI) and my psychiatrist did tell me that it is going to take a few weeks to see changes. But for the last 3/4 days I have been observing that my energy levels have increased because I have been able to sleep well and it is so much better. My IBS has decreased and I haven‚Äôt got any migraines. I‚Äôm really really glad the medication is helping. If anyone is out there looking of options, and one the fence of trying medication, go for it. I‚Äôm sure if it working and it will help.",train.csv

It was like my hormones just completely controlled me and my brain just turned off. What kind of person attacks their friend like that?

When I am a guest at a hotel or a friend's house I clean up and keep my space tidy. My house is a completely different matter. I have learned that it is because of my depression that my house is like this. I live alone and so it is up to me, alone, to keep my house clean. For the new year I want to make the resolution to clean my house and make it organized and keep it that way. I recently started taking Zoloft and I've noticed that I'm able to keep things picked up. For example I take my used dish and put it in the sink (I have a pile of dishes to do so we're just going to focus on the fact that I took the dish down in the first place instead of keeping it in my room). I get overwhelmed when I have to clean a lot. Partly because my grandparents were so completely anal about cleaning that it's almost my little rebellion.

"Post: Hey everyone! Quick little backstory: I am 22 years old and have suffered from depression since I was around age 14. During that time I took Zoloft with a Xanax PRN for panic attacks. Earlier this year (around May 2017) my primary doctor upped my dosage by 50mg, I was then taking 150mg. My body adjusted to the increase and I hated how it made me feel. I felt worse than before. As if it worsened my symptoms. So, full well knowing the dangers of stopping a medication like Zoloft, I stopped taking it around the end of July 2017. At first I was fine. Them a month had gone by and I was bad. Then a few months later (Nov 2017) I was the worst I had ever been in my life. I lost 20lbs from Thanksgiving to now... I don't have an appetite, even though I feel hungry all the time. I have extreme fatigue. I am always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. I am stressed because student loans kick in this month ($515 a month), and I cannot afford to visit my family doctor because of $ I owe from previous visits. Is this 20lb sudden weight loss something that can be attributed to depression? I am generally a very healthy person. I workout daily, but haven't been able to the past month because of my extreme fatigue and depression. That's why it confuses me as to why I've lost weight. I am 22, female, athletic build, 6'0"" and 178lbs. Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit. If it is, please direct me elsewhere. Thank you guys for your time. ‚ù§",train.csv

"Post: I'll just cut to the chase. I'm very depressed and not entirely sure why. I have a lot of stress and trauma so I think that contributes to it but I really can't point to one thing. I am only happy when I'm with a select two people. Neither of which I see often so I end up very depressed when I'm not with them. I'm good at masking it while I'm with people but as soon as I'm alone it hurts so much. I used to think that taking my life seemed completely abstract but now it just seems closer to reality. However, I know I would never because I have a lot to live for and a lot of people care about me. But I just need some way to get rid of the pain. I can't see a therapist reguarly due to complicated reasons. I was curious about anti depressants I don't know much about them but I just need some way to not be sad all the time.",train.csv

I don't want to slip, I've gone almost 3 years without self harm and I'm proud of that, but I'm scared.",train.csv
"Post: This morning my mom took me to a psychiatrist appointment I‚Äôve been waiting for for months. Immediately, he began questioning why I was there when I had good grades in school and seemed fine. Also asked if I was restless all the time and I said yes, and he told me no I wasn‚Äôt because I wasn‚Äôt fidgeting at that point (even though I was shaking and playing with my Kleenex) Then my mom mentioned the eating disorder clinic I‚Äôve been going to and he asked my bmi and I‚Äôm not allowed to know it, so he made me stand up and started patting me down to get a ‚Äúfeel for my weight‚Äù. By this point I was crying and he just continued to make me feel like I was faking it or shouldn‚Äôt be there. It took me 6 years to speak up about this and now I‚Äôm regretting it because I always feared I would be told that I was overreacting or faking it. Was uncomfortable the whole time too because he was sitting with like less than a metre between us and. I have to go see him again in a few weeks and I‚Äôm so terrified, I‚Äôm still crying and it‚Äôs been 3 hours.

"Post: I can't really remember exactly the last time I didn't want to kill myself. The feeling has always been there but I didn't really acknowledge it until about early high school. I can say with pretty good confidence that I've wanted to kill myself everyday since then. Reading many posts about what people have been through and their current awful situations just makes me feel more guilty for being suicidal even though I have a caring family and am decently well off. My birthday is on new years. I was born just past midnight, so my family and I usually celebrate it on New Year's Eve. However, the last few birthdays I haven't been happy. I always work for my parent's business because we're constantly understaffed. I don't have freedom. I just work. On top of that, I have to deal with the constant desire to just die while having to work. Every year, I'm scared of what the new year will bring, and I resent my parents just a little more for letting me become the happy little accident that I am now. Couldn't they just use a condom? 2016 has been one giant clown fiesta for me. I'm fully confident that 2017 will be just as bad. I want to make it all end now but I'm too scared of the pain and the nothingness that will consume me once I'm gone. I'm not religious so I don't believe in an after life. Often times I wish I were, that way I'd be more inclined to just get the ""pain"" part over with and to just kill myself already. There's no real order to what I'm saying. I'm just venting I guess. I wish I would just kill myself, instead.",train.csv

Whenever I am doing something with her, texting, sitting next to her, thinking about her I feel genuinely happy. Games have basically ceased to exist in my happiness radar. However, she is also one of the reasons I am depressed. I heard her tell me ""I love you"" and I love her too, but my depression prioritizes everything in my mind, even my feelings for her so half the time she is the only hope I have and the other half she becomes this endless pit and I fall deeper and deeper. My life has been put into shambles because of this stupid mind game my brain put on itself.",train.csv

"Post: I'm currently going through some hard times and have no emotion towards it. I have ME (mialgic ensephilomitis), ME makes you become very tired very quickly to the extent that at times it even inhibits the ability to properly think. I have other issues but that's the main one. it first started in the middle of my freshman year, I'm now a junior. Because of it my doctors have removed me from any school and I'm to tired to do most things. This has made it as if I have been frozen in time while the rest of world continues forward without me. At first this was heartbreaking and I went through depression, however during that time I always thought that my emotions were not nearly as strong as a normal person's would be in this situation. Since then I have stoped being depressed but have also stopped feeling emotion towards my situation completely, both positive, negative and even neutral emotions, I just don't feel. I have also started finding it very difficult if not downright impossible to feel empathy towards others, or any other emotion for that matter and I have been left with only logical reasoning -when I have the energy to properly think- to an extent. So I am wondering if my lack of emotion is normal or not? Is there anything I can do about it because it feels very unnatural.",train.csv

I guess this is the only major achievement of my life, as she is beautiful and smart. Amazed we actually connected. I constantly have a feeling she's going to leave me due to the fact I can't keep up with her. She has achieved so much. Scholarships, awards, friends, and more. I did nothing in my life. My teen years were spent playing videogames. I did anything and everything I could to waste time and make my life go by faster, because I assumed I'd be happier when I got older. Unfortunately I've realized that I should have used that time to train my brain and focus on grades/academic achievements. Now I'm as dumb as a brick. I have no career direction. I don't think I'd ever be able to work in a field that makes serious money. I still don't have any friends other than one online friend, and my girlfriend ( who has many real life friends ). I've never had any real life friends. I don't know what to do. My brain is already fucked. My memory is so bad. I feel like I've lost the ability to learn. Once she realized I'm destined for failure, she's going to leave me. Then I'll be truly alone again. She already knows I'm not smart. ( not sure why this hasn't scared her off yet ) I can't take it.

I've been doing pretty okay during the day, but at night I am almost always suicidal. Yesterday, I cried from 7PM to 1AM and it was completely exhausting. It took everything out of me and I just wanted to end it all. But then, by the morning, I am almost completely fine? Like i don't even feel depressed or suicidal at all... and then I invalidate my depression and I question if I do really have it or not? But then the cycle continues... suicidal at night, okay during the day, questioning/invalidating my depression and then suicidal at night again.

"Post: The last few years of my life have been really difficult for me. I've been dealing with a couple sexual assaults that all happened during the last 5 years. And its just really bad timing because these past few years were supposed to be me learning how to adult and shit. So instead of learning how to cook chicken or graduate college, I've been sleeping a lot, smoking weed. Trying, failing, and succeeding at coping. Anyways. My parents do everything they can for me, but they have their own problems too and they aren't the most educated or successful people in the world (career and finances- strictly speaking). So sometimes I get a bit frustrated with them. So a couple weeks into December, and my mom tells me I have to sign up for healthcare because they are dropping me from their plan. I applied quick, but I guess since it was so close to the deadline and lots of others are doing the same, the state still hasn't followed up with me. (I was notified that I qualified, and that the next step would be to wait for a rep to contact me). My therapist will be back from vacation next week and I've been hanging on a thread without her. But I just realized that I might not be able to have an appointment with her if I don't have health insurance. So right now I'm kind of in a pre panic attack state.

"Post: I am making this post mostly because for the 1st time ever somebody has called the police on me reporting that I was suicidal.

So I am constantly questioning my worth and life based on that alone. But the cops came by my house just a couple of minutes ago and asked if I felt suicidal, and I told them no, because honestly right now I feel ""fine"". Fine in the sense that I feel I can function normally and at least for the rest of the day and probably just stay in my room and read or play random computer games. So I ask, am I even considered suicidal? While I do constantly think about what would be the repercussions of killing myself(My family kind of depends on me financially atm) I have never actually made the attempt to kill myself(Honestly just too scared I think).

"Post: I've been fat all my life. Have been depressed for a year and a half now. When I wake up, sometimes I literally can't move my legs, because the bottom part of my spine hurts SO MUCH. I've been on a diet 2 years ago, lost 33Kg of the 60 Kg I had to lose, the pain went away for some time, but I just gave up on the diet for several reasons and the pain returned. Anyway, just wanted to share my situation :/ When I manage to get a small victory against depression and ""wake up"", I still have to fight against the pain that doesn't let me move without moaning. If I try to get up, the bottom of my spine hurts, if I manage to stand up, my legs feel like 2 sharp spikes stinging my waist, and every step feels like a marathon :/.

I'm lost. -Culturally I don't feel like I have any sense of national identity. I'm British but I don't feel tied to that culture or any other. - Ethnically i'm mostly white, however slightly not ,so i've never felt at home in white society. I also notice many things about white society that are problematic. - Sexually i'd say i'm mostly straight. I've only ever been in love with women and sexually am only interested in women for the most part. However, I do sometimes feel affection and aesthetic attraction for some men, sort of like a crush but not sexual? This is another reason why i'm lost. - I don't like or relate to any of my family. - I don't feel tied to religion or atheism. - I've never been in love and can't seem to build connections with anyone. I feel so lost. I don't feel like I have an identity. I don't belong. I've always been depressed but I have no idea why. How can I find answers?",train.csv

"Post: I moved to a new city away from my family and friends and ex-SO for the greatest job opportunity I could ask for right out of college. And somewhere along the line of my first real week of days off, I realized that all I did was work and I was just curled up in bed every second I was not working. I've thrown myself into a job so completely that I didn't even realize I stopped eating and slept too much. Now I'm back at work, and I didn't realize how lonely I felt being so far away from everyone I ever cared for. It's just a part of growing up, right? But I can't help but break down in the middle of my work day and lock myself in a bathroom trying to breathe. I've suffered from depression my entire life, but it has never been this bad. I've lost over 20 lbs and I was already only 5 foot and 110 lbs. And my apartment is pristine because no area but my bedroom has been used. It's been 6 months of this. I'm giving up and trying not to give up at the same time, if that makes sense. I decided to come home from work early today and cook myself a decent meal for lunch tomorrow, and it's the first thing I can say I'm proud of actually doing, but I feel pathetic at the same time.

I've dragged down those who are closest to me, because maybe they know, but I've never felt so grateful towards anyone for merely existing near me. I'm much more ready to get happy seeing something than I was, and maybe this was due to some desparation to get out of the vantablack-coated hellhole that I fell into, but slowly I started to look at life as string of vignettes, with a moment of quirky charm thrown in sporadically. I'm still far from escaping this pit, but were it not for moments like those, I'd have stopped this nonsense a long while ago. It's made me appreciate things that I've never cared about, even if moments where I truly smile are few and far in between.

I've been back half a year, got straights As, and was pretty proud of myself. The hardest part for me is that I can't find a job, even though ive tried. Holidays are over, everyone's back to their own life , and I get hit with the backlash. Saying I'm useless and lazy because I'm not a working and productive person in the world. My dad basically told me I was a loser and if I'm not working by tomorrow I'm out of the place. Being told your useless , a loser, losing your place to live, for something you are working for , is a horrible combination to hit someone struggling with anxiety and depression. This time tomorrow Ill be homeless, and I don't have basically any friends from moving back, so I have no one I can turn to now but my own head is driving me into a downward spiral . I have been doing good depression wise. Doing the right things and the next best step, but now I have lost all motivation to even open my eyes. The past 2 days have been me waking and falling asleep crying knowing tomorrow I have nothing and no one, and contemplated ending it . Tomorrow im terrified because once it happens I know I'll loss all hope. If anyone can send any sort of encouragement it would mean everything. Thank you all.",train.csv

I can't be around my family because I'm sick of faking my happiness, I can't be with my friends because they don't realise the extent of my depression and I always bum them out by being too anxious to say anything. While I was planning my death a month ago, I got a message from my friend telling me she's getting a house with her boyfriend and I'm invited to her party, I was so shaken up that I didn't know how to respond and said ""cool I should be able to come"". I then deeply upset her for not congratulating her and she instantly started saying I was being a bad friend. She's aware that the girl I've liked for years is attending this party with her boyfriend (which is obviously extremely uncomfortable) but she told me to suck it up for one night so she can enjoy herself but... I just can't any longer, I'm sick of pretending I'm fine for the sake of others. So in the end me and this friend have fallen out ever since and I've decided I'm not going to this party for my own sake, I get the feeling that this will upset her but I just cant endure any more of this torment. I've had 2 suicide attempts ever since this happened a month ago and I'm scared I might try again if she messages me telling me I'm a bad friend. I just can't deal with any of this any longer, I can't be what people want me to be any longer... And it's not me being a bad friend, it's me being depressed and wanting to live.",train.csv
"Post: I know for me I came to realize by my late teenage years that I have developed dual brain consciousness. What I mean is I alternate between two states at any given moment. Around friends and family I ""turn on"" my visual hemispheres. I actively look to be creative and funny and this drains my energy. When I'm alone I turn off and operate entirely on unconscious awareness. I will stare at the wall and ""recharge"" No thoughts, no feelings, like a dead man. People who caught me in the ""off mode"" have told me I have dead eyes. All of this translates to my sex life (non existent right now) But when it was active I was never able to cum inside a woman. The reason being sex is a spontaneous act. And i operate like a robot in the off or on mode. I simply can't let go like other people. This is what causes my depression. Could be autism, adhd, or any other host of illnesses. Bottom line is after 25 years I realize you can't change it hard as you try. The neural pathways planted their roots long ago. This causes me pain because all I ever want is to socialize and keep appearances like normal people",train.csv

Whether thats true or not, I think I really need help with my life. I gotta feeling that I don't do anything good with my life. I am just wasting time on the internet to distract myself. I just want to know how to start to take action. I think I know excactly what I should do to become happy and to fix my life. I collected information, made daily tasks (which are totally possible to fulfill) and want to improve many aspects of my life, though i become overwhelmed. I don't even manage to stick to my healthy eating plan. So I end up doing nothing or just a few things and waste most of my time. I need to change something drastically. So my question is: is there any trick to start taking action? Any form of mind trick? How can I motivate myself? I just need to go through some days to see the improvement and then hopefully it gets easier, but I need a start...and at the moment I feel like I am stuck in this pot of laziness, vegetating.

When compounded with existing depression, it makes me feel profoundly isolated sometimes.

She‚Äôs going to leave me because I‚Äôm not good enough and never will be good enough to love anyone as beautiful as her the way she deserves. Maybe it‚Äôs kinder to let her go so she can find someone who really loves her and can properly show it. Not me.

I have a heart condition that has been steadily worsening after a miscarriage, and due to it, I can't hold down a regular job and have since resorted to online work that pays like shit. I'm homeless. I have only two people in any sort of position to provide support, emotionally. And even though it's looking like the most difficult parts of life are ending and getting better for me, I don't honestly believe a life with all these new restrictions is worth it. My family is going on vacation soon. I wasn't invited. That week, I can complete the steps the way I planned, if I want to. Now the question is if I even have the physical strength for one last shot at it. Who knows? It might fail again. But I have no doubt I'll keep trying. It's the only thing I haven't given up on. Meditation and such seems to point me in this direction. Tarot readings, horoscopes, all of it seems to be dropping hints that this is it.

My parents have always told me that I shouldn't even be depressed, considering how easy I have life compared to others, and as much as I hate to say it, I agree. As much as I really just want to fix everything, I feel like I just want to kill myself. But I can't do it. I don't know why, but I can't. No matter how badly I want to do it, I can't bring myself to do it. Maybe I'll just have to learn to accept living like this.",train.csv

I used to be open about my depression with my close ones but now I find myself hiding any signs. My friend tonight saw my bandaged wrist, despite my long sleeves. He told me he could tell lately that I'm not me. He said it was like someone had taken my soul and heart and everything that was me out and left just my physical body. I think I have to tell my therapist I need help. I don't trust my decision making whatsoever, I'm gonna fuck up if I don't do something about this. I just hope I don't lie to my therapist.",train.csv

"Post: My parents are divorced since I was 3. No big deal, many people started off worse. I've been living with my mom and rarely meet my dad because I'm too busy. Recently, I met up with my dad and my foster mother, and they thought I might have some psychological problems. Not severe, but still. They wanted to get me checked out. But my mom don't agree. She thought the other parents were overreacting. Personally I do feel off balance at times, and I WOULD get myself tested just to see if I'm okay or not. But even when I expressed that wish, mom still wouldn't take it more seriously and ignore it. I don't want to come to my dad crying out for help because that would just make my mom and dad argue once more, and many many more problems regarding my family might ensue. But I still feel really upset with the fact that mom wouldn't get me any help even though it costs her nothing. Thanks for reading, I know there are people being in way worse situations than I am, but I just need to take this off my mind.",train.csv

"Post: Apparently, people hate it when others talk about their suffering online. People figure if you're talking about how depressed you are on social media, you must be faking it or looking for attention. A sincere cry for help makes you an ""Attention Whore"" apparently. I hate it when people dismiss others' pain as insincere just because they posted about it on social media, and even going as far as to make jokes about it. Also, I hate people dismissing others' pain because of their age. I saw a tweet once that was like, ""If you're under 23 and claiming to be depressed, you aren't really depressed. You don't know depression until you're an adult"" or something like that, and that certainly isn't true. I knew two people, one in middle school and one in high school, that were hospitalized for weeks from suicide attempts. Please, don't assume others are making up their pain ""just for fun"" because more often than not, the person behind the screen is actually suffering. That's all.

After a week or two - I can't remember the exact time - I had something that I think might have been a psychotic break of sorts. I cannot remember my line of thinking at the time, but long story short, I found myself walking down the road (meaning I had walked down my driveway which is all jagged rock and about a mile long, and about another mile down the road). My pocket was full of pills and a knife-like object. I believe I was headed to a pizza place which is miles and miles away. I've never actually put that into words, but I am now realising stupid that is. I have no idea why I was going to there. I either wanted to end it or run away, but again, it's fuzzy.

We've gone from a really good friendship to barely talking at the end of the day, mostly because of routine. I still care about this person greatly, but its pretty clear thats not the case for this person Over that time period, my mental state has just gone down the drain. This person was really my only reason to get out of bed in the morning, and be the best version of me that I can be. I've gone from an A student, to a B student, to a C student, and now im having trouble bringing myself to do any schoolwork at all. I just want to lay down and sleep, even though im getting less than 5 hours a night. I've been having suicidal thoughts for the past month and I honestly dont know how much longer I can hold out, with the lonliness and the stress given for being an academic student (Canadian system) I've always been more of a lonely kid, but over this friendship I was shown how much greener the grass is when you have someone to talk to, someone that (seems) to enjoy your company, and can make you smile.",train.csv

"Post: I'm a girl in my mid twenties who has two friends, a job that's steadily decreasing my hours, no car, and no real hobbies. I've struggled between keeping myself entertained, keeping my depression at bay, and balancing my anxiety with my attempts at socialization. But I feel like no matter what I do, I always end up feeling alone. I used to be parts of groups, used to make friends in school, used to have things to do outside the house. But now I feel like I'm going through the motions of each day and not taking anything away from them. The worst part is feeling alone when I'm surrounded by people. I was out just two days ago and almost immediately wanted to head home. I've always considered myself an extrovert but lately I've found it hard to connect with people. Even in my own home, where I have a few roommates, I feel like nothing I do to interact with them is ever enough. One of them is obsessed with his video games, one is barely ever home, and the other one is dealing with anxiety issues of her own that I always feel like I'm bothering her when I try to hang out. And now the icing on the cake is last minute cancelation of our New Years plans (for valid reasons), but then instead of the four of us watching the ball drop together, everyone went to bed early leaving me yet again alone.

"Post: For my entire life, I've been a little off on the inside. I feel like I have felt everything. I had deja vu all the time when I was a bit younger, like I had already seen everything. This grew into anger and hatred for non-original thought. I see it as people thinking that they say original things, but in my mind, it makes me extremely frustrated. A little while ago, I started watching anime, primarily moe content. This woke something in me, and it wasn't good. It left me with very high standards and expectations of females, both physically and in terms of personality. Lately I've been seeing all girls around me as unimpressive, and I desire something more. At this point, I was on the verge of depression. I'm seeing everyone as inferior and not worth spending time with. This is strange for me, because for my whole life I've loved others and felt extreme empathy and compassion for everyone. So here I am, with high standards, irritable, possibly depressed, lonely, confused and wrathful. Now, another unreasonable standard in finding a female my age (16) approaches. I have developed a desire to be obsessed over. To the point where she'd hurt herself for me. I'd feel immensely sorry afterwards, but I'd still make her do it again. (Sick I know...) I don't know if I want the feeling of being the hero or what, but this has become somewhat of a must for me... I've read a lot of 'help', nobody feels the way I do.

I'm considering paying for expensive non-va counseling. Being stuck circling the drain is costly but so is seeking a historically futile chance at therapy. I sometimes wonder if it would be easier to hire a person to simulate being the subconscious driving force that all normal people have moving them forward in their various directions...if only to get me in a habit of being that kind of person. What is a man? Where did I stop changing things that dissatisfied me? How is my creature so prone to giving up?",train.csv
"Post: I talk a lot, fairly flippantly usually, because that's what you do when you've had depression your whole life I guess, about hating myself, but I was just thinking about it, and I don't think I actually do. (This is not a positive post, by the way, this like... gets worse from here, my head is in a super bad place and I really somewhere to vent where no-one irl is gonna see it. Just a warning.) See I think hating or loathing someone takes this huge amount of energy. You have to be conscious about it. I think that's why it's not unusual for someone who really hates them self to also be pretty narcissistic. But for me, it's not a big effort. I don't hate myself, I just.. don't like myself. It's kind of like, when you have a group of friends, and there's one person in the group and you just don't get why anyone likes them. It's not mean-spirited, necessarily, you just don't find them interesting, or funny, or smart. They're not good-looking enough for you to think that that's why people still seem to like them. And you don't think about it all the time, maybe, but it bugs you. You find yourself rolling your eyes when they talk. When they're at events you're like ""seriously? who invited them?"" But when they're not around, you don't even think of them. They don't take up enough of your notice- they aren't remarkable enough- for you to devote any extra thought to. And I guess if I could sum that up in a word, that's how I feel about myself.",train.csv
"Post: I have run into 2 major problems in my life atm, it has been eating away at me for the better part of a month. I‚Äôll give you some backstory: I have people pleaser all my life. I feel like I have always gone with the flow, with people‚Äôs expectations of me rather than have my own. I have done that since I was a kid and I‚Äôm now turning 20 this year, And with that being said the first problem I have run into is, I don‚Äôt know what I want and like partly due to the depression. But mostly due to the fact that I‚Äôve never really done or said what I wanted to to outside forces shutting me down at every turn (school, parents etc.). Idk and it‚Äôs driving me up a wall. 2: I thought hard about the people pleaser trait in my being a lot and I have come to this conclusion, I hate who I am. I believe that I am selfish and feel because I haven‚Äôt done what I have wanted in my life I am inauthentic. So I go and look for outside validation and love because I feel like I am incapable of it. But when I receive it, and it doesn‚Äôt hit the way I wanted it to or things are too fast or far. Like a addict I dump them and look for a new person to give me that feeling I long for. It‚Äôs fucked up, because the other people care about me and I do to to an extent, but I prioritize my own feelings and shit first. And that realization fucked me up so bad. Real bad.

"Post: I've been depressed for more than a year now, I am a teenager and self-diagnosed but I'm absolutely sure what I've been going through is depression. I confessed to my mother I was depressed once and she felt really awful, asking what she did wrong and it made me feel terribly guilty... so when she asked if I needed to be on medication and get professional help, I lied and said no so she wouldn't feel bad. Anyways, I've been going through these periods where I feel really good. Most of the time I'm content and sometimes I even feel happy. It lasts for a little while, last time for almost a month, and then I start slipping again. It's like a cycle, I'll feel good, then I'm depressed again and then, it gets really bad to where I'm seriously contemplating suicide. I don't want to die, I really don't, even when I say I do... but in those moments, it's serious. I hope you understand what I'm saying, I'm also extremely self-conscious, I've read this over a hundred times. Anyways, currently, I feel good again and I know soon that I'll probably return once again to a depressed state but, I feel really optimistic. This makes no sense, I'm sorry.

I cried for probably 45 minutes over nothing. These episodes are happening more and more frequently. The last time I remember feeling this way was when I got the bright idea to stop taking my Cymbalta completely, and that was an unmitigated DISASTER.

"Post: I'm not sure if this is just because I'm growing up and becoming an adult, but I don't seem to have much emotion at all anymore. I just don't really care about anything, I'm never really sad and I'm never really happy. I'm just.. neutral.. all the time. Whereas in the past I remember having fun and happy times, I feel like happiness is a feeling that I *used* to experience, but I don't really get anymore. I'm just existing because that's what everyone else is doing, going about my day doing whatever, sorta like a robot with no purpose. I constantly ponder how meaningless everything is.

And every morning after that, when I wake up, I cried because I still exist. I have grown to ultimately hate myself. I feel like the most trash ass human being... When I try to express this to other people, it will either be met with the ""tough love"" reprimand, or I end up pushing that person away because of my negative energy. I don't even know myself anymore. I don't have any more passion for things I once did (cooking, massage therapy). I attempt to develop motivation, but my depression and anxiety will team up with the PTSD I incurred from being robbed. When I notice negative self-talk, I'll try to change my thought patterns, but it always ends up back at ""The world would be better off if you were gone."" But I'm too much of a coward to try and take myself out again... I just want to be happy, man.

Its like there is a constant voice in your head telling you that you are worthless, pathetic, useless, a failure, a disappointment that you don‚Äôt deserve happiness or to be alive but to only feel pain. It makes you feel like you are forever trapped in an abyss with no way of crawling out. Sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel but it always drags you back deeper than you‚Äôve gone before and the impossible cycle of escaping begins again. No matter how much you try to escape the darkness, your brain yearns for the dark thoughts to return because it happens so frequently that it becomes the comfort zone for it. You begin to doubt everything about yourself; telling yourself whatever you do isn‚Äôt good enough and you should just stop trying or its worthless to just go on and might be better to just end it all. You feel like you are nothing and will be important to anyone ever and when you are gone everyone will be happier knowing the pathetic failure that they once knew will be gone forever and can no longer fuck up their lives. All the smiles on the outside is just a mask to cover how you really feel. You cut because you feel like you deserve the sharp stinging sensation as the blade cuts your arm open and the blood slowing oozing out.

Just before this happened I was planning my suicide because I've been dealing with depression for most of my life and now that this happened.. it almost feels like ""god""(I'm not religious but this is how I feel about things, since everything is so terrible I just start having these delusional thoughts) instead of putting something good in my life to make me want to live, decided to put something terrible to force me to be alive for longer so I have more time to suffer, almost like I'm paying for my past sins, I've always tried so hard to make my life and my family's life better but I only see it deteriorate so at this point it only makes sense to leave.. The only things that make me feel happy are things from the past they have no more influence on my present life, is it fair to live just because you have good memories? These memories are slowly disappearing.. I feel so sad about having such a negative view of life because I am aware that life has beautiful things and I feel lot of guilt about my suicidal thoughts, I feel sad for my family, I feel sad for my past self, I feel bad for whoever crated life seeing me so unhappy with what they gave me, almost like someone gave me my life as a present and I want to throw it away..",train.csv

I‚Äôve had asthma attacks, and this didnt feel like one (no wheezing/ out of breath) it just feels like no matter how much i breath, i can‚Äôt get enough air. and it also feels like my heart beat is extra loud? if that makes sense. also, it‚Äôs vey uncontrollable. there was no immediate stresser, but i have been stressed about life in general lately. like what i‚Äôm going to do in the future, a job, etc. the whole episode lasted half an hour or so. i also get this feeling when laying in certain positions, being too hot, and feeling too constricted. none of these took place tonight, though. is this a panic or anxiety attack? does anyone else get this?? any help is appreciated :) add on: the feeling is similar to as if someone were holding my heart and lungs in their hands, and slowly tightening their grip. not sure if that makes sense but it‚Äôs the best way i can think to describe it",train.csv

"Post: So I heard that I should find a creative outlet to help cope with my depression... I've been suicidal for 5 years, pretty much as long as I've been depressed. Im to cowardly to actually do it but I just kind of wanna stop existing, I'm just extremely sad although I don't fully understand why. So I'm kind of by myself venting because nobody really cares, I spend most of everyday just talking to myself... Mostly self hatred negative thoughts and I guess I'm a small cause of my depression. So I'm kind of just looking for a creative outlet to let out my sadness and depression, so I have like three ideas for it. One of my major ways of coping with depression is joking about it, it has become a really good coping strategy believe it or not. I wanted to do a couple things 1 I wanted to start a YouTube channel 2 I wanted to start publishing my art 3 I wanted to start animating I really enjoy drawing, I love it and it's a form of coping for me. YouTube is kind of just something for me to not feel alone, I probably won't actually do it though I just think it'd be interesting to get like minded depressed people to kind of hang out idk but there is a lot of us that seem to relate easily. Animating has always been kind of cool, I love adventure Time and Rick and Morty, although it's kind of expensive at first I think it'd be a fun hobby for me to invest in. Do you guys have any tips though, im just trying to keep my head up as long as possible without breaking down.",train.csv

I carried it in my wallet, travelling towards my senior years in high school to the end of college. Perhaps you were kind. Perhaps you were pitying me. Perhaps I misunderstood what you were trying to tell me. I can't speak or think for you. So when I wrote you a message telling you how I felt, you read it, and you never replied back, deleted me, dropped me; completely eradicating my existence a year after I left, I still held that note. Did you hold mine? I would appreciate a response from you, even if it's this late in time. I just want to hear it from you. Why you spent time with me, and why you wrote me that letter. What was the use of being my ""friend""? I told myself I'd burn this note that you gave me once I've become happier.

"Post: I have improved my life significantly over the past two years: I found an antidepressant that works for me, I've gone back to school, I've got a steady job, I've even gone on a few dates, and I adopted a dog to give me a place to focus my attention and love on. I thought that if I could improve myself, or at least improve my situation, that it would feel better, and in some ways i guess it does. The depression is still there though. It's not as constant ,and in fact as long as I'm around someone, my friends, my family, or even my dog, I feel alright. But it never really goes away. Sometimes I'm watching a movie, or listening to a song, or taking too long to go to sleep it hits me. In these moments I remember that I'm a useless waste of life. All of my accomplishments are stripped away to reveal the fact that I'm just a bunch of nothing. In time it goes away but it's never too long before I revisit those feelings. Is it the same for anyone else? Can you truly ever ""get over"" depression?",train.csv

I hope you don't mind me. For a while now I have not been able find the motivation to do much of anything. When I have a break from school I mindlessly click through useless videos on Youtube or various useless articles. Virtually nothing holds my attention. I can't get through an episode of a tv show without reading something else. I can't read through interesting articles, I can't finish any books, I can't draw, I can't do any research or even clean my room. Essentially, I can't accomplish anything unless it pertains to a greater purpose than simply enjoyment, or if I have made myself accountable to someone else, and even then I have trouble finishing tasks. It was honestly difficult for me to get out of bed and shower for the past couple of days. I am on winter break currently. What makes me the most afraid is that I haven't been thinking-- especially thinking creatively. If I have a new idea to ponder, I never pursue it. I used to constantly be thinking of new art projects and writing prompts, even though they never came to fruition. In school, I am ridiculously bored. I am lucky if I pay attention for ten minutes straight in any of my classes. My grades are fine, however. Could I have some advice, please? I am saddest about my lack of curiosity. Even when there was nothing interesting to do, I always had my imagination, and now I am bored with my own mind. Anything you can say to help would be greatly appreciated.",train.csv

"Post: I guess this isn‚Äôt really a stereotype, but I often see depressed people in movies/shows/etc portrayed as a person fighting their depression alone, meanwhile trying to make everyone else in their life happy so they‚Äôll never experience that sadness. But ever since I‚Äôve been depressed (roughly 5 years now) I‚Äôve been the most cynical person. I hate other people‚Äôs happiness, when someone accomplishes something all I do is think about my failures. I obviously am outwardly supportive, but inside I‚Äôm so resentful. I feel like am truly an awful person, I don‚Äôt remember the last time I was genuinely happy for someone. I really just cannot connect with people on any emotional level anymore. I just feel like alien. Does anyone else feel this way? Or do you try to make other people happy to make up for you not being happy yourself? Does this help you, as in does other people‚Äôs happiness help to alleviate yours slightly? &amp; also, to people that don‚Äôt resent other people‚Äôs happiness, how?

"Post: Indubitably, I am not worth anything as a being, contrary to the belief of all redditors who will reply to this, I have never once done anything correct in my life, all I have ever succeeded in has been to be hurtful and disrespectful to others and taking others for granted. All I breed is catastrophe. I am not at all talented or skilled at anything in particular, I am below average in every concept known to man. I have no motivation nor intention to progress in my life. I seem to be an inconvenience, an unpleasant burden towards society. I'd say my existence is more so comparable to a tumor, I am not productive and only produce negative effects on others that unfortunately have the unbearable pain that comes from interaction with someone like me. Entrapped in this body, I dream of going into eternal sleep, a great rest that lasts to the end of time. I do not have any interest in anything anymore, daily politics bore me a great deal and I'm not at all intrigued by life at all. I don't see a reason to not follow through with it when I have no intrinsic value and no drive nor intent to live at all.",train.csv
"Post: Hi guys, I might need some help. I'm dangerously close to becoming a full alcoholic. Whenever I feel down, i grab the bottle. Sometimes I get drunk 3 times a week, the minimum is 2, but sometimes it's even 6 times a week. Just got out of an 11 day drinking binge. I'm only 18, I can't let the booze take over. My friends and I joke about, just because they don't know the extent of the problems and I'm too pussy to tell them. I just feel so much better when I'm drunk. I am smarter, more social, don't think about my problems as much (until an hour after the last glass, then the depression really hits hard.). I just always feel like I have wasted the last 18 years of my life. I have litteraly nothing to be proud of. It hits hardest when my friends asked what I've done all day, and I just have nothing to say. So whenever I'm down, I'll get drunk, knowing I'll feel better for a while. The depression itself isn't that bad, it's not always there. I feel perfect half the time. Dunno if it's even a real depression. Took half an hour just writing this, as I can't type correctly anymore, so I have to write the whole thing basically three times to make it correct. Again, I don't know if this was the right place to go, but I had to talk to someone about it.",train.csv

I just want to be alone at home, unfettered by expectations to be cheerful or give or get gifts. Christmas and New Year's are over, and I still feel this melancholy weight blanketing me that won't go away.

I'm expected to smile and participate in these rituals, even by the people who know me well enough to know that I want to be miles away from anything to do with a holiday.

Still trying to figure out the logistics of when my first appointment will be with the doctor but I‚Äôm proud I am taking a step in the right direction. I think my slide into depression the last 6 months is from the loss of my dad as well as some other personal issues (hated my job/fallout with some friends/bad breakup) but it took 6+ months after all that for me to finally realize I needed help. I was sleeping in, just watching tv/playing Xbox and avoiding my friends at times when I started to feel anxious. I started becoming more and more of a recluse but at this point I‚Äôm done with this feeling. I have gotten a new job and mentioned to my boss that I might need to show up an hour late on Fridays for my therapy. She couldn‚Äôt have been more understanding and supportive of it. I was nervous as hell to tell her but glad I did (depression hasn‚Äôt effected my work, in a weird way it‚Äôs the one part of my life I have felt empowered/productive). Sorry for this rambling but I am only posting this to hopefully encourage others to do the same. I know everyone‚Äôs depression is different you can get help.

I started having social anxiety problems around this time as well. Most of my friends started experimenting with drugs and alcohol, but I knew that wasn't for me. Still my social anxiety made me think that because I was different than them in that way, they wouldn't like me as much. I was also scared they'd pressure me into doing it with them. So I started to socially isolate myself. I'm in college now, and I really don't talk to anyone besides my family. I have two people I talk to at my job, but we don't hang out outside of work. I've learned how to keep myself entertained, but now I long for companionship. I still sometimes struggle with my social anxiety and am afraid of putting myself out there only to push people away like I did before. Also I'm kinda shy so it's hard to talk to people lol.

When i was a kid, i didn't think of it much. It's like 'this happens and i'm sad for some reason'' and it lasted briefly. 5 min max. I googled these waves and experiences were pretty similiar to mine from what i've read. But people there seemed to be on some medication and i never was. I was as young as six, when i remembered the feelings of these waves. It felt like pure sadness and dread. It would get me so out of nowhere too. My heart would suddenly feel too heavy and it seemed like it would slide down from all that weight it was suddenly carrying. I kinda felt like i wasn't in my body either.

To add to that, I had bone fractures which forced me to go through 2 painful surgeries over the span of 3 years (the first one to add a fixation device to my bone and the second one to remove it). The amount of antibiotics and painkillers I used only makes all the symptoms I have much worse. Sometimes I feel like I am the most unfortunate person in this world. And as a result, the fact that I have all these symptoms in my 20s when all my friends around me are super healthy makes me suffer from depression as well.

"Post: So like many of us, I've suffered from anxiety and depression for my entire adult life. Pretty severe depression to be honest. About 5 years ago I started taking Celexa under my general practitioners recommendation , and it was incredible. It made a huge difference in every way possible and it was like I was a new person. Eventually I (stupidly) weaned off it, thinking I was ""cured"" and went for about 2 ish years not on any meds. Eventually I predictably fell back into my depression. Went back to the doctor. We tried celexa again- didn't work. wasn't anything like the first time. then put me on wellbutrin- didn't really work either. then we finally tried effexor- same deal, didn't notice any positive changes. I don't exactly remember but I believe we also tried upping the dosages of these meds also. i'm getting increasingly frustrated and unsure of what to do. i've been struggling finding the right meds now for years. I would give anything to go back to that ""clear, happy"" feeling I got from my first batch of celexa. but i've not been able to find it. does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions for me? what is the next step? any other meds that I might recommend to my doctor to try next?",train.csv

"Post: Hi there, so on the 21st of December my doctor prescribed me 20mg Citalopram (Celexa) for my anxiety, depression, CPTSD and OCD symptoms. Unfortunately at the exact same time I became quite ill with the most troubling symptom being difficulty and pain urinating so the doctor told me to quit the drug to rule it out. I'm still struggling a little bit with this now after a week of being off of the drug, but it turns out it's actually just pretty bad constipation. That's getting better now so I'm wanting to give the medication another go, but I'm really worried about the sexual part of the side effects. The few days I was on Citalopram, I lost all interest in sex. My penis felt pretty much numb and masturbating just to relieve myself was a stressful chore thanks to the delayed ejaculation. I've heard quite a lot about how these are side effects that don't really pass with time and may even continue after treatment with the drug stops, that's terrifying to me. What's the use in getting me out of this depression and anxiety and possibly being able to get myself another girlfriend if I'm not even going to be able to perform properly anyway? Or even enjoy it? This might be a deal breaker for me so I was wondering if anybody has had any positive experiences with this? Did it pass over time or go back to normal as soon as you quit the drug?

My anxiety was all over the place and I was constantly having panic attacks about it but, I finally did it. It honestly feels weird to be happy though. Even if I should be feeling proud of myself and all it just feels weird to feel happy. But it felt so good to have someone understand everything I told them, and not just shrug it off and act like it's just because of my age or ""just how I am"" because of my past or anxiety getting to me. It feels so nice to have someone actually understand me for once, and understand what's happening, and how my situation is. We talked for about 40 minutes and she had a really strong accent but, it was nice. My anxiety eventually faded away, and she helped more than my own family could. I finally feel happy though, and that's all that matters to me right now.",train.csv
"Post: I've felt proud of my success in overcoming most of my depression in 2016, and at least making some progress in seeing most people as good. But the end of this year has really taken a toll on me, especially after the election. It's not because of who people voted for, but because of all the horrible things on the Internet that resulted from it! I've always taken comments a little more seriously than most, but why not? If people express what they're really thinking on the Internet, than how can you trust anyone? How many people are friends with another race, then talk s*** about them online? How many people lack empathy for others? How many people condemn others for trying to speak out against hate? How many people really care? Despite thinking all this, I've still resolved to being a kind person and trying to understand others, even if their way of thinking is unfathomable to me. But i don't know if i can keep up the faith if this is how people really think. I just want people to be caring, but i know it's not as simple as that. I thought i was getting better, but i just don't trust people anymore. It doesn't seem like anyone really cares.",train.csv
"Post: Hello, happy new year etc, etc. Not sure if anyone will read this but I'll write anyway. I've been feeling so darn depressed for the past years and it has gotten so much worse lately. I only eat and sleep, like, all day.I have nightmares every time I try to sleep, and I wake up feeling like shit. I got so much to study and I've fallen behind. I feel so empty and no matter how much I've tried to give my life some meaning, it all feels so pointless. I'm sick of waking up, I'm sick of breathing, I'm sick of being here. I haven't been diagnosed with any kind of mental illness, basically because I avoid talking to people about how I feel. (Can't afford a therapist either). However, I don't know if a diagnosis would matter. Because I kind of feel helpless and I really feel like it doesn't even fucking matter if some prof in a coat tell me ""oh hey something is wrong with your head"". (no shit man) This feels so overwhelming, and dealing with it seems impossible. I've talked to some of the people around me, but most of them are the kind of people that like memes about mental Illnesses, so their reactions were like ""Oh I'm depressed too haha"" , or ""You have nightmares? Welcome to the club"", ""you're suicidal? Cool me too!"". Reactions by the same people who said they don't want to die because they have things they want to do.(Don't get me wrong, I love my friends) As for my family, they call my childish and say I have no reason to be depressed. Idk this post is a mess, expressing feelings is definitely not my thing. For anyone who read this far, thanks and I'm sorry.",train.csv

Since NYE I've been super depressed again - defined by the idea that I am not hopeful and any fresh start I have will inevitably lead to another dead end. Will a fresh start change the way I look or change how attractive I am? Will a fresh start make me more likable? More outgoing? More equipped to make friends and meet new people? The truth is, it doesn't matter how many fresh starts I am given: I will always, fundamentally, be the same person, and I will continue to let forces outside of my control define who I am as a person.

Even though I find it REALLY hard to talk about, I‚Äôm considering just being totally honest and talking to them about my depression, and how much it‚Äôs eacallated this year. Let them know that it‚Äôs not just my work that has suffered, but my finances, soicial life, family life, health, everything. I‚Äôm not trying to use it as an excuse, it‚Äôs just the truth. I don‚Äôt know that it will save my job, but at this point I don‚Äôt know what else to do. Has anyone ever done this. What do you think? Any advice? I‚Äôm so scared of losing my job and just spiraling further and further down.",train.csv
"Post: I was scared he was going to do what he did to me to another little girl, and so I finally reported my bias to the police nearly 6 years after it had ended. There was no physical evidence and so to press charges they need me to testify in court. I‚Äôm going to testify, but then I‚Äôm going to kill myself. Regardless of the verdict, I will have made my disgusting and horrible actions known to the public so history cannot repeat itself, and little girls will be safe from the predator who stole so much from me. It‚Äôs just so much easier to guarantee that my suffering will end than to expect a court to do right thing. In all honestly, I never imagined living this long, I never thought I‚Äôd make it to my senior year of high school. I‚Äôm supposed to go to college in the fall, but I‚Äôll be dead by then.

Every day I look at suicide methods and and it's the same fucking articles and posts. It's almost funny. I stopped taking my useless antidepressants because I was tired of being asexual, now I have these brain zaps and it's so weak. I just laugh or cry for no reason at times.

"Post: Over the past year I've lost the majority of my friends. It started off with a health issue that I obviously couldn't prevent, which somehow made me lose most of my friends in high school. I then thought I was alright as I still had a couple of very close friends. I was outgoing, and some other people still seemed to like me. But almost immediately after graduation everyone stopped talking to me. And now in college I still feel so upset and bitter about my high school experience that I don't know how to open up to new people. I'm quiet, introverted, and can't connect with the people I meet. I've met a ton of seemingly great people that right after meeting me escaped becoming my friend. So now I'm lonely in college, my depression is creeping back up after years of carefree happiness, and I've taken to the Internet and video games as my safe place. It's a life that's depressing, but I hope that one day I'll stop feeling so numb and alone. One of my closest friends recently just stopped talking to me. We used to play xbox all the time together. Now she hardly answers my texts, giving the simple ""busy"" excuse. I've spent too much time trying to be supportive and loving when other people won't give me a minute of their own time. This is only one example of why I've become only a ghost of my typical self. I guess, has anyone ever dealt with this? Are you dealing with this now? These types of things only seem to happen to people with depression and other mental illness, which is one of the cruelest things imo.",train.csv

He's an excellent listener and an interesting guy, I've texted him and he's texted me since then. Sometimes I tell him about my depression and my eating disorder, and how awful I feel. He listens patiently, gives sympathy, and makes some suggestions without being presumptuous. But he never tells me about his life. Even if I ask. He has never tried to share any of his own problems with me. Ever. It was even like this when I was still dating him. When he texts me first, it's to ask how I'm doing. Any time I get quiet for a while, he stops contacting me. Even for months at a time. Then when I come back again, crying about my own problems, he's there to listen. Patiently. It's obvious I'm not his friend. He tells me he's glad we met. But he only talks to me for my benefit. He's doing a good deed. I deactivated my facebook messenger since that's how I usually contacted him. He has my phone number. But he will not use it. Maybe this time I'll finally leave him alone.",train.csv

Here is my reasoning behind this feeling, most people I know or have met when I was smaller said I was really charismatic, outgoing, etc but that I changed all of a sudden what I can guess was when I was around 6-7 based in the few memories I have. I became serious with out any sign of change and now I don't care about anything, but mean absolutely anything it is what can only be described as ""detached"". It could have been from suppression of who I am since that age because of people having expectations for me resulting in me not developing any real hobbies/interests and knowing how to express my likes/dislikes or due to some other events that led me to suppress myself.

"Post: I am currently in my friend's restroom breaking down for the last ~30 minutes. Aplogies for the wall of text. In the eyes of many, I am sure my life is fine. I am moderately attractive with a relatively outgoing personality and decent intelligence. I get lucky with some thing and have the best friend group someone could ask for. Yet despite all this, I still am overwhelemed with depression. To preface, my depression is sometimes caused by outlying causes, but mostly seems to manifest randomly whenever it wants to. I graduated in 2010 with high expectations from my folks. Nothing too crazy, but significantly better than I performed. With depression and anxiety, I have skipped on many of the opportunities in life (fun, women, careers, etc) and can't seem to truly overcome it entirely. I trick myself into believing it is gone for periods of time, but it inevitably comes back harder than the times previous. I now am sitting in 2018 having accomplished little outside of making a good friend group, and while having gone into business with a close friend, feel like I am the weak partner. Ultimately my whole life feels like I squandered it and wasted myself when others could've capitalized and lived a happy, fruitful life while my depression and anxiety rules who I am to this day. Frankly, I don't feel deserving of the opportunities I have recieved, regardless of any good I have done. I know it's stupid for someone in my situation to feel this way with so much good in life compared to most others in this subreddit and elsewhere, so i'm sorry. Hope you all have a good year.",train.csv
"Post: I really just want any glimmer of hope to cling to that my life won't end empty and alone as it has been so far in my years. There's really no chance of my romantic situation ever changing though... So I'm back to sitting alone with no hope, just me and my shitty brain I don't even want. I don't know why my depression is so bad today, not sure if it's the new year and the prospect of going around again with the same old bullshit of being rejected or the amount of happy couples I saw today. That always gets me... Seeing people happy, just wishing you could feel things like love, affection, closeness with someone...but knowing that's the one part of life you are permanently gated from. All I want to do is die but I can't so I guess lifetime of misery it is..",train.csv

"Post: I went to a club with pretty good DJs last night. I went there last year as well and enjoyed it. Last night though at first I was fine and everything was cool but it got to just after midnight and I got this overwhelming feeling that I should leave. I have been feeling low for the past couple days and just felt really anxious and upset on the day of NYE. My mood had slightly picked up before we went out but once we were there I just couldn't escape what I was feeling. My girlfriend was naturally really upset and couldn't understand why I wanted to leave. After having a bit of a row I just yelled ""It's because I'm fucking depressed!"" and left by myself. I have feelings of guilt - obviously I know she wanted me there but I let this mood I'm having control what I do. It must have looked strange to everyone and I feel like I wasted the night and an opportunity to have fun. Having said that the feeling I had making me want to leave was so overwhelming I wouldn't have enjoyed myself at all. This scares me - this hasn't happened before, I am usually a sociable person and enjoy having fun with my friends. For the past couple of weeks though I've had this feeling that I just want to stay in bed and do nothing - finally last night I acted on it. Is this depression? I really can't tell if I am or not and it worries me that this behaviour might be the start of it.",train.csv

I have gone to therapy for years to better myself and always tried to be the best person I can but it didn't work. I hate myself so much. I am a burden to my parents, very few people care about me and I am a waste of space to be alive. I know my parents will be upset but they will get over it quickly because they have my brother who is extremely intelligent, handsome and very well-liked. My dad will for sure be okay because he had two kids from a previous marriage and one's a doctor about to get engaged and the other owns her marketing agency and is married to a great guy with two beautiful children. I come from a family of overachievers and I have never measured no matter how hard I tried. They are also very attractive people and for some reason, I came out looking so deformed and ugly. I just feel like there is no point in trying anymore. I screw up all the time, I am a huge loser and very few people like me. It's better I do this now than waste another 25 years alone.

My sister apparently has struggled a long time with anxiety, and there's some talk about suicidal thoughts as well. I got to know this through my mom just now.

I am quite aware of the progress I made the past few months and I have even considered myself depression-free until I had an episode after feeling very stable for three weeks. I realized that depression isn't a one-time thing that can be cured with constant means of pharmacology. I am now in this state of wanting to kill myself (again) but is too lazy to get a knife downstairs.

""You just gotta get out there and meet more people."" Rejection is a bummer, but if you also get the occasional date from trying, then it makes up for it.

For instance, picture an Instagram filter than is dark and bleak. I have always been a dark/unlively person and I learned to find bliss and stress reduction in my seemingly cloudy lifestyle/outlook. My ""happy"" emotions are mainly nostalgia and excitement. Like i said, i have been happy at certain points in my life, but i still always have that ""filter""... And sometimes I take solace in it.

"Post: So the best I have ever felt while on antidepressants is for like 2 or 3 days after starting (didn't feel like sleeping for ever, had some evergy, had some motivation). Then as the medication levels out I feel like crap again. This has only happened with 2 meds that I recall: cymbalta, an SNRI, and wellbutrin. The same thing happened when my doc increased the cymbalta dose. So what I am asking is can anyone explain this? The only logical thing I can come up with is placebo effect because you should maybe start to feel better after 4-6 weeks but I only seem to get better for 48-72 hours and then go back to feeling the same as before that. But if it was placebo, why has it only done that with those 2 medications? The only other thing I can think of is that I have a different underlying condition that keeps counter acting the meds, but I feel like I'm just grasping at straws, but I'm sick of trying medications and the only relief I get is not wanting to die 24/7.

"Post: Who's else is gonna spend their new years eve alone? My friends promised to come over to my place, I even cooked the food, got some drinks for us all. But.. only now found out that they are all chilling at other dudes place. Smh, and they all ignore all my messages. Fun ._. Already dealing with my anxiety and depression.

"Post: Hey. I've never been diagnosed with anything so I don't know if I'm supposed to post here, but I couldn't really think of any other place. What am I supposed to do about my worth? I feel as if everything I try is a failure and I convince myself of that fact. I can't handle any criticism because it consumes my entire mind and destroys any confidence I had to do something. I'm now finding it impossible to do any schoolwork because I've decided that no matter what I do I'm going to fail. I have no intimacy in my life and that makes me feel like I'm not good enough around my peers. It kills any confidence I have around people so I just try to avoid any social situations. I know these thoughts are unhealthy but I can't even force myself to try to get better. Maybe I'm just too sensitive and a pussy.",train.csv

Post: I went to a massage parlor where I'm pretty sure an unprotected act has led to me contracting HIV. I was in denial when I got flu like symptoms thinking it was the flu. In the interim I did not have sex with my partner but I think she's come down with it too. Why the fuck should I not end it right now? There is no coming back from this,train.csv
"Post: I have someone who is depressed and well she cannot talk easily to me about it. She used to but now it's harder for her. I tell her it's okay to talk to me about it, it won't change anything between us but she says no. That she'll hurt me by telling me what she feels. I tell her that it's okay to hurt me I can handle it. I don't really know what to do about it and why does she find it hard to talk to me. I do my best not to hurt her in any way. She thinks that she'll lose me if she said anything. A bit of advice would be appreciated.",train.csv
"Post: I'm a mid-20s woman with rapid-cycling bipolar II but I'm posting here because I'm asking about antidepressants and how to control my depressive episodes. My moods were under control when I was on lithium and zoloft, but the zoloft (50 mg, so not much) absolutely ZAPPED my sex drive. I would force myself to do it to please my partner (no, he did not coerce me). Aside from that, I felt the best I'd ever felt. No complaints otherwise. Last June, I went off the zoloft and stuck with the lithium and felt fine, but I felt some depression symptoms coming back after a couple months. My anxiety and reactivity increased, but I was still WAY better off than with no meds whatsoever. In December, my psychiatrist recommended an NDRI to help prevent a change in libido. I started wellbutrin (100 mg so again, not much) and it was definitely helping, but now I'm feeling some depression symptoms coming back again. I have spent the last week thinking I'm stupid and pathetic and useless for no apparent reason. My psychiatrist thinks I did better on an SSRI, but the lack of libido was awful and not something I ever want to experience again. I know that particular symptom varies from person to person, so I wanted to know about others' experiences with those classes of antidepressants and if symptoms varied from drug to drug, even within the same class.",train.csv
Post: severely suicidal. My doctors want me in the hospital but I refuse to go. been there done that it doesn't help. they want to tinker with my meditation. Im considering ect as a last resort. anyone here have it done? how was it? did it help? I won't make it if I continue to feel this way. This is the worst i've ever been. I have zero hope and zero convincing reasons to want to stay alive. This depression is literally killing me.,train.csv
"Post: Sometimes when I am overwhelmed with anxiety I go crazy. My mind cannot focus or complete any task and I act extremely irrationally. I crave to do something irrational, such as fuck an oxy addict, drink myself to oblivion or message my ex. I end up messaging people im close to, sharing too much information about myself and my mental state to them. wtf is this lmao",train.csv
"Post: Well its been 2 hours since the first humans on the planet began experiencing 2018. And yeah, life might be a meaningless and near endless well of suffering, but on the flip side the worse life is, the stronger we are for having gotten through it. Cheers to you all. Here's to another year of depression, and hopefully the last for many - that is, the last because happiness waits around the corner and if we keep fighting we'll get there soon. Cheers.",train.csv
Post: Nothing I do feels real. I feel like I've lost myself because I don't enjoy anything anymore. Everything I do just fills me the same feelings of saddens or anger I don't know what to do anymore. What can I do to turn the corner and get out of this state.,train.csv
"Post: Over the past few years of depression, my bedroom has begun to look like an episode of the Hoarders TV show... Thankfully without the bugs. Most of the mess was me just not doing laundry. My cleanliness standards were such that I didn't do laundry more than once a month, but still refused to wear dirty socks and underwear. So, being the high functioning depressive that I am, I would frequently buy new socks and underwear as I ran out and febreez my jeans and shirts between washes. The underwear took care of itself as I also gained a shit ton of weight and threw stuff out as it no longer fits, but... This week I'm doing laundry. I'm trying to clean my room (ugh). I've done 5-6 loads and I'm still not done. I have so many socks I can fill an entire basket with *just* socks. Has anyone else found themselves in this situation? How do you cope? TL;DR: I kept buying socks while super depressed. Started doing laundry and now have a fuckton of them. Wat do.",train.csv
"Post: I feel as if people are ignoring me and what I say now. Some of my friends have become really popular and whenever I say hi or call their name they either look at me like they don't know me or just flat out disregard that I'm even talking to them. Barely a few friends have stuck with me at this point. My crush has seen me at my desk when I'm going through a rough time but she just ignores me. She has talked to me frequently but it just seems that she doesn't care. One of my friends who I thought was my friend leaked out that I'm autistic and have ADHD as well as I take medications for that every day. Now, whenever I walk around school people look at me and laugh while talking shit about me. Some have called me a freak and leave the school and go to a mental asylum. I've been called a mistake so many times. All this has been affecting me emotionally and physically. This has been making my depression worse and has increased my levels of anxiety. I've been having more anxiety attacks since this all started. Everything around me is starting to become meaningless to me. Nothing other than my mom, my dog, and my little brother give me a genuine source of happiness. The people at my school have made me feel even more worthless than I was before this. I want to feel accepted by someone other than my family. (I consider my friends family as well) People who don't talk shit about me or don't look at me strangely just disregard I'm there. Maybe their all right, maybe I really am just a mistake.",train.csv
"Post: I was doing better for a few weeks. Went on vacation for the holidays and it was supposed to be great. I never got that down time I so desperately needed. Now I go back to work tomorrow. I feel physical pain from the inside out. I want to scream and cry and tear my body apart. I hold my wife back. She makes more money , spends less, and is more adventurous. She would have moved to another state or country by now if not for me. All I do is waste money and time. I am bad at my job but we are short staffed so they won't fire me until things settle down. And I hate what I'm doing. But I got my masters and I have student loans to pay off. That is what is keeping me from commotion suicide. My wife would be stuck with the loan payments. But my God I want to die. Please kill me!!!",train.csv
Post: I stopped being able to watch movies months ago. Now I‚Äôm finding myself in conversations I and I have no idea what we‚Äôre talking about.
